  * different parts of the brain
    * emotional brain
      * the reptilian brain (oldest part of brain)
        * responsible for everything a newborn baby can do - arousal, sleep/wake, hunger, breathing, chemical balance
      * the limbic system (mammalian brain)
        * what is it?
          * seat of the emotions, the monitor of danger, the judge of what is pleasurable or scary, the arbiter of what is or is not important for survival
        * nested physical structure
          * thalamus
            * what it do?
              * the cook of senses into soup
              * all sensations converge here and turn into a coherent experience of what is happening to you rn
              * after above point, sensations are then sent in 2 different directions: 
                * 1) to the amygdala (the low road)
                * 2) to the frontal cortex (the high road)
          * the amygdala
            * what is it?
              * smoke detector
            * what it do?
              * determines whether input is relevant for survival
          * the hippocampus
            * what it do?
              * relates new input to past experiences
      * what it do?
        * assesses info in a global way - finding vaguely similar patterns - this is why a tiny rope on ground catching eye can cause you to jump automatically before rational brain kicks in to show not a snake
    * rational brain - neocortex
      * organized to sort through a complex list of options
      * nested physical structure
        * frontal lobes/cortex - make up majority of neocortex
          * what they do?
            * they are what make us unique in animal kingdom
            * allow us to think abstractly, plan, imagine, sense of time and context
            * responsible for [[empathy]] - this is where mirror neurons are
