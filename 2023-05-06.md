  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Not sure if die-off or what, but definitely had chronic fatigue past 48 hours. Really feel weakness in arms and legs. Sat in chair with legs in bad position and caused pain that lingered really long even after fixing posture
    * Lot of stuffiness today and drainage
    * Kidneys been feeling better slowly despite still doing Rapaport's experiment. Maybe bc weed or maybe just random? Still confused what caused the pain
