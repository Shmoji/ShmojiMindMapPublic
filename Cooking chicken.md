  * Servings

    * 1 thinly cut chicken breast is enough for 1 meals

    * 1 regular chicken breast is enough for 2 meals, but barely. I'll just say 1.
  * cook whole breast in frying pan
    * 5-7 minutes on both sides 
      * this is what internet says, but i had to cook additional 10 minutes and still uncertain if it was cooked completely. Will report if it makes me sick lol
    * mistakes to learn from

      * make sure to smash breasts flat before cooking so they cook evenly
