  * Lex poddys
    * 1st poddy with Jeff Bezos
      * i related with how Jeff said he was an inventor and how he explained it. Lateral thinking. High-dimensionality space. Search space is very large - inventive skills get triggered.
  * Machine Learning Street Talk poddys
    * tracking Pattern Recognition vs True Intelligence with Francois Chollet
      * [[2024-11-24]] MLST hosts, ARC-AGI, FC's paradigm
        * **Dr. Tim Scarfe** is host for MLST and most of them - glasses and cool accent
        * **Dr. Keith Duggar** not in this poddy but seen as cohost in past interviews with Levin - round face and asks good questions to Levin despite almost seeming like Qs wouldnt be good
        * main focus was ARC-AGI - intelligence/agi test open since 2019 that has not been completed that seems to test intelligence v well
        * created by FC (and i assume a team). The main paradigm FC talks about (that i assume is also used in ARC):
        * 1) program synthesis - combining programs in ur mind in unique ways, often relative to context/input rn i think
        * 2) abstraction generation - generating abstractions which are functions/programs stored
