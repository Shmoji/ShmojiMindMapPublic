    * observations
      * you can see i listen and then when about to be my turn to talk, it takes me a lot of energy. dont think super obv to external, but obv to me watching back. if i think i need to talk, i look right to my notes. I guess bc 1) i want to say right thing 2) i want to ask questions in my notes and try to make those questions connect to divergent convo

      * Should i do less talking and more listening and just questions?
