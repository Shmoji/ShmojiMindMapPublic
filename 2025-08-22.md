    - saw Dr John Boyle at Wilmington Health ENT today
    - he didnt really tell me much of anything useful, but i kinda like him relative to other ENT i have seen. He seemed very uncaring and uninterested emotionally, but he seemed quite caring rationally and gave me lots of agency as the patient.
    - main thing it seems i can do is CT scan and that may show issues related to salivary glands, lymph nodes, infections, abscess - in the submandibular region and the sinuses
