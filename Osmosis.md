  * What is osmosis?
    * A method that makes molecules move from one side of membrane to other side
    * There are 3 main methods used to transport molecules in and out of cell across the cell membrane
      * 1: active transport. It spends energy to cross cell membrane
      * 2: diffusion or passive transport. Does not spend energy to cross cell membrane. 
      * 3: osmosis. Movement of molecules (typically fluids) from higher concentration to lower concentration through a semi-permeable membrane.
  * Questions
    * Does osmosis only work in water?
      * In biological systems, the solvent is typically water, but osmosis can occur in other liquids, supercritical liquids, and even gases.
