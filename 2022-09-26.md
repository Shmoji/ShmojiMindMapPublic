    * Today i saw Dr Garwood about lymph nodes. She said they felt normal. Didn't want me to get ultrasound. I really would feel more comfortable if i could get ultrasound though.
    * Area under jaw was hurting me 4/10 until around 7:30pm. Why did it get better then? Only thing that changed is that I did back stretch/exercise where you put back flat to wall and lift arms up in L shapes.
