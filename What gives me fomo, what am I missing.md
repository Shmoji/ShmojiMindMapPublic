  * im missing whatever makes it easy to provide good facial expressions during conversation
    * example: if someone says something funny, almost always it feels like my face doesn't want to even smile. What's double weird is often i feel laughter inside, but my face just won't smile or laugh. 
    * brainstorming
      * often wonder if this is caused by all the pain in my face from my health issues
