  * what is it?
    * Fire is the RAPID [[oxidation]] of a material in the [[exothermic]] chemical process of [[combustion]], releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.
    * Slower oxidative processes like rusting or digestion are not included by this definition or by combustion.
  * Why is Fire Self-sustaining?
    * You need 3 things for fire: heat, fuel, and oxygen. Take 1 away and fire goes away
    * A LOT of heat is produced when volatile (it evaporates when heated) gas of fuel combines with oxygen. This keeps it self sustaining
