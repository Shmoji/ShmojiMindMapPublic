    * it is night before deep cleaning. Feel 8/10 bad. Skin burning 5/10 throughout whole body, especially bad on head and face near red-spot areas on nose. Jaw, under jaw, and throat is swollen like 3/10 and pain about 3/10. Been feeling weird warm sensations in body. Feels different than burning feeling. This is some butt cheeks lol. We'll see how I'm feeling after deep cleaning tomorrow. These symptoms weren't really happening much until she made my gums bleed while checking gum depths due to them being inflamed and probably infected. So she must be spot on and hopefully it iz ze feex. 
    * Took Claritin D past few days, so maybe stopping it today made inflammation get an ego
