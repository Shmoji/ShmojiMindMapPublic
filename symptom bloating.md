- things that definitely bloat me
    - cereal: The Original grape-nuts. Brand: Post. Super healthy actually. But the main ingredients are indeed wheat/flour which is known to bloat me, BUT who knows maybe iz not the wheat/flour

  * tracking when it happened to me
    * [[2023-10-31]]
      * had shrimp poke bowl for lunch. had grain silo for dinner. had sun chips. had few dark chocolates. Bloating was at about 3-4/10. My guess is something in grain silo
      * maybe some relation between this and this same day in [[tracking hiccups]]
    * [[2024-01-17]]
      * i had pasta, meatballs, broccoli (prob something else) as meal from work. After this i was like 3-5/10 bloated all day - my best guess is bc the pasta
    * [[2024-01-24]]
      * bloating about 3-4/10 after work today. Had chicken cordon cleu at work - no idea what all is in that. Had non-issues stuff for dinner, some chips, and goat milk yogurt. My buest guess is lunch meal caused it or yogurt did. I think goat milk yogurt and cheese may cause me to bloat, but not totally sure on that yet.
      * will note i havent been eating chocolates, but still bloated, so less likely chocolates cause bloating

      * had like 4-5/10 blowtorch last few days. my only guess is due to #onion from Neo Japan. But im not confident in that
      * it seems like recovery from bout of bloating is multiple days, which then makes hard to detect new triggers when already bloated

    * [[2024-03-01]]
      * has 4-5/10 bloating past 2 days. Maybe bc i ate Chicken Saag? but idk cant remember if i was bloated before that or not. I think i was after eating custom bowl from Fside, but it was more like 2-3/10
      * i feel current bloating at all times when sitting or standing. Certain laying positions i dont feel it
      * As always, it's better in morning and gets worse over the day
      * Will note, im taking [[colostrum]] rn
    * [[2024-03-13]]
      * last few days i wake up and im like barely bloated. Lunch i get a lil more bloated, but barely. After dinner, i get v bloated. But also how bloated depends on what i eat
      * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/teriyaki fried rice neo japan#^3wkeKAXp5|had same bloating thing as last time - more than the hibachi fried rice 4 sure. Also didnt even touch the onions this time. So what about teriyaki sauce causes bloating?]]
    * [[2024-03-20]]
      * havent been too bloated lately. But then ate thai coconut fried rice and got moderately bloated. It has onions is only thing i can guess
    * [[2024-10-22]]
      * directly after and next day im like 5.5/10 sure i have more bloating than usual after eating Moes homewrecker bowl. i think i noted this down in past before too. think my best guess is it's the guac, but not sure
    * [[2024-11-26]]
      * bloating 2/10 from mid-bottom V-line
      * all i ate today: small amount of raisins, non-ripe banana, white rice, sotanghon, my dark chocos
      * my best guess for cause of bloating: my chocos i guess??
      * i had pikadillio yesterday, but dont think that is cause but idk
