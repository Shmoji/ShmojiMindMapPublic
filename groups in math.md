  * what are they?
    * much less abstract than groups in everyday talk. They have a legit formal definition and limits
    * fundamental concept in abstract algebra
      * other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms.
    * a set (1) and an operation (2). The operation is not an element of the set.
    * DEFINES BINARY OPERATION: A group is a set of elements together with an operation (like addition or multiplication) that combines any two elements to form a third.
    * formally defined as a set equipped with an operation (fx) that combines any two elements of the set to produce another element, and it must satisfy four group axioms: closure, associativity, identity element, and invertibility.
      * Closure: For any two elements a and b in the group, the operation on a and b (denoted by ab) also belongs to the group.
      * Associativity: The operation is associative, meaning (ab)c = a(bc) for all elements a, b, and c in the group.
        * i understand this mathematically, but dont know what i really means
          * an operation is said to be associative if the way elements are grouped does not affect the final result. So seems it depends on the operation itself
      * Identity Element: There exists an identity element e in the group such that for any element a, ae = ea = a.
        * what even is the identity element? if it just equals the original element - whats the point?
          * its significance lies in its role as a neutral element under the specified operation.
          * using the identity element in the operation has no effect on the result. It's like multiplying a number by 1 or adding 0 to it; the result remains the same.
          * Here's why the identity element is essential and has practical implications:
            * Simplification and Reduction: The identity element allows us to simplify expressions and perform calculations more efficiently.
            * Building Blocks for Structures: In algebraic structures like groups, the identity element serves as the foundation upon which the structure is built. It helps define the neutral element that keeps the structure well-behaved and consistent.
            * Inverses: The existence of the identity element is closely related to the concept of inverses. In a group, for every element a, there exists an inverse element a^-1 such that a * a^-1 = a^-1 * a = e (where e is the identity element). In other words, the identity element plays a crucial role in defining and finding the inverses of elements in a group.
            * Characterizing Structures: In many algebraic structures, the identity element is unique, and the properties of the identity element help to characterize and distinguish these structures from one another.
      * Invertibility: For each element a in the group, there exists an inverse element a^-1 such that aa^-1 = a^-1a = e, where e is the identity element.
        * In other words, the identity element plays a crucial role in defining and finding the inverses of elements in a group.
    * Various physical systems, such as crystals and the hydrogen atom, and three of the four known fundamental forces in the universe, may be modelled by symmetry groups. Thus group theory and the closely related representation theory have many important applications in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Group theory is also central to public key cryptography.
