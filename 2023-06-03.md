    * lower back where kidneys are hurts on both sides 4/10. Has been this way for over month now. Reasons why: Rapaport's drug experiment (one of those supps caused it) 2) the last kidney stone flare up that sent me to ER caused kidney to swell up and maybe something related to that caused it. Makes me wonder what "it" is tho. Always a reason for some pain, especially consistent ones.
    * many times over many months, when i do the back stretch for fixing rounded shoulders and forward neck posture, it causes sinuses to crackle. why??? how is that related at all??
