      * lunch: cod liver, brown rice, sauerkraut, apple. About hour after eating this my jaw pain went from 0/10 to 3-4/10. For some reason i became incredibly hungry like just after eating this lunch. I wasnt even that hungry before lunch

I ate a shit ton of 92% cocoa dark chocolates today. I searched it and the chocolate is probably the cause. Caused by caffeine and theobromine - which are both diuretics.]]

      * for lunch, i ate brown rice and cod. Then, i ate a ton of sliced up apples. Then, i ate a bunch of Moe's chips. Then, i had a banana. Then, i didnt need to, but i ate some goat cheese that ive chomped very quickly in last few days instead of savoring it over the days.
      * This order was specific. I know i always want a snack after a meal. I know i often dont like aftertaste of apples. So, i ate apple slices and then chips. I seem to always want something sweet after eating chips, which is why banana came next to end eating.
      * But then i desired the goat cheese in fridge that i didnt plan to eat bc i had been chomping it down so quickly over the days. I think it's because my reward center knows goat cheese has strongest taste of all these things
      * Around same time i noticed a possible horny feeling - which makes me think this is all very related to reward center really desiring quick reward.
