  * tracking thoughts on safety
    * [[2024-05-03]]
      * Bryan Johnson as source in my words: apparently with some chocolate, excessive heavy metals can be an issue. Helpful if the chocolate vendor will share heavy metals testing
      * i eat beyond good madagascar dark chocolate melts and their site says: "We test for the presence of heavy metals in all of our bars once per year. Our chocolate is safe. It has naturally occurring levels of cadmium and lead. These are not harmful for human consumption. All of our products are in compliance with strict quality and safety requirements of the U.S. FDA and Californiaâ€™s Proposition 65." - im skeptical now tho
      * seems biggest issue is cadmium and lead. Redditor: "The cadmium comes from the soil as the tree grows and the lead comes from dust/dirt blowing onto the beans as they dry in the sun on the ground"
      * someone asked in blueprint community if there even is a safe chocolate. Seems there are some that are more transparent and more safe, but still have some heavy metals. Bryan sources his own cacao it seems and mixed reviews on where he gets it. 
      * one of safest chocos seems to be Mast. Bryan Johnson seems to use santabarbarachocolate for nibs (whatever that is) and cocoavia for something else. im gonna try santabarbarachocolate.

  * tracking thoughts on pricing, time to eat, amount eating

      * for last however-many-months ive been spending about $10 per week on beyond good madagascar dark chocolate melts. Im thinking about trying this: https://www.santabarbarachocolate.com/bulk-mini-criollo-chocolate-wafers-chips-100-cacao-unsweetened/ - im worried about how that price would compare per week to beyond good - bc i dont really know how fast id go through this new choco.

      * alright, just finished eating one bag of the Santa Barbara mini wafers above. Delivered to me on Aug 13 2024 and i finished today
      * NOTE: i didnt finish entire thing. It is delivered in a box containing 3 2lb bags - costing a total of $129 - i only finished one bag. it took about one month and i consumed 2lbs of chocolate lmao
      * woah that's fascinating - im basically spending the same amount as with Whole Foods chocos AND eating almost exactly same amount - nuttyyy. And in reality i may be saving money, but just a guess

      * alright, i think i started bag at last note and finished today. so ate 2lbs in 1 month and 2.5 weeks
    * [[2025-01-02]]
      * started bag last note and finished today. ate 2lbs in about 2 months. i was purposely eating the chocos in certain patterns
      * ended up doing every 3 days pattern usually. every 2 days felt like too much heavy metals in me
      * intuition says it may be even healthier to do every 3 days, but then only eat on 3rd day if craving it above threshold
