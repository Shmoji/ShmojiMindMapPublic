      * i found a beautiful beat to sing to. I took "atreyu" lyrics below and tried manifesting them in that beat. I notice when vocals are planned out at long time-scale, it's just almost never good. It's like i have to get very present to moment and almost forget the lyrics, but still sing them at same time.
      * using above method, i got a few good sounding stuff, but nothing good enough to keep
      * i wonder everytime, what's best way to go from lyrics to a working song? do i create beat/rhythm by looking at lyrics and singing to self to manifest the beat? currently not really possible until ai enables that. so i have to take some other beat and try to match lyrics to it, which is then maybe a vibe mismatch?

      * i tried training model on guardin and then having that voice sing my song. It still sounded bad. Which i think is sign i need to practice manifesting that thing that i dont know. Is it rhythm? Vocal rhythm maybe? I know what it is but dont know how to label it. It's like an authentic flow of vocals that makes a song good
      * experimenting with how to go from lyrics to vocals. Trying to vibe with flow of lyrics and flow that manifests from them while beat is in background and i dont even put focus on beat. This actually seems to be working. Maybe. Seems to require me to do that thing where outside of time.r

      * Jeremiah said he usually does consonants or whatever they're called to a beat - then create lyrics to the sounds of the consonants/sounds. Matching lyrics to beat is way harder he said.

      * While singing in car on way home for xmas, i had realization. Previously had realization that letting go of everything is important to let yourself sing good. But often even that stops working. Today i realized when that stops working you want to originate from that letting go energy BUT lean into your actual self (the not letting-go energy)
      * also important to allow yourself to sound stupid and make mistakes, but that's part of the letting go step
