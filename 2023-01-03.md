    * Pretty high pain levels today, 7/10. Just gonna note some notable things. Consumed very small amount of weed (not enough to notice mentally) about 3-4 days in row, yet still in pain. Saw sunrise and sunset, yet still in pain. Took Epsom salt bath, yet still in pain. Drank turmeric yesterday, does it increase pain?
