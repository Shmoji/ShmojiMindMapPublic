  * what is it?
    * a type of design used in LLMs
    * It's responsible for handling and processing language data effectively.
    * key components
      * Input: Text is converted into numbers, known as tokens, which represent individual words or characters (discrete objects). These tokens are then embedded into a continuous space using embeddings, making it easier for the model to work with the data.
        * my summaries
          * how it works: text -> tokens -> continuous vectors (arrays of values) -> now can do statistical magic which relates back up
        * what is a continuous space?
          * A continuous space, in the context of language models, refers to a high-dimensional space where words, phrases, or tokens are represented as continuous vectors. This space allows the model to capture the semantic relationships between words, as similar words will have vectors that are close together, while dissimilar words will have vectors that are farther apart.
        * what is a continuous vector?
          * Continuous vectors are arrays of numerical values (scalars) that can take any value within a specified range or interval. In the context of language models and embeddings, continuous vectors are used to represent words or tokens in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a specific feature or attribute. These vectors are "continuous" because the values they contain are not restricted to a finite set of categories or integers but can assume any value within a continuous range, such as real numbers.
        * what does "embedded" mean and what are embeddings? ^XPPhjCCbS
          * "Embedded" means to map or convert a discrete object, like a word or token, into a continuous vector. In natural language processing, embeddings are continuous vector representations of words or tokens. Each word or token is assigned a unique vector in this high-dimensional space, which allows the model to understand and work with the text more effectively.
            * What is a discrete object?
              * pattern i noticed:
                * The similarity between discrete objects and NFTs lies in their unique and non-interchangeable nature. However, discrete objects pertain to data representation and analysis, while NFTs are related to digital asset ownership and management on blockchain networks.
              * Words and tokens are considered discrete objects because they represent distinct, separate entities. Each word or token is a unique unit with its own meaning and identity, and there is no inherent numerical relationship between them. For example, the words "cat" and "dog" are discrete objects, as they represent two different concepts, and there is no way to naturally express their relationship in terms of numbers.
              * A non-discrete object, on the other hand, can be represented in a continuous form, such as a vector or a value that can take any value within a specified range. For example, temperature is a non-discrete object as it can be represented by a continuous value (e.g., 25.5 degrees Celsius), and there is a natural numerical relationship between different temperature values.
              * By converting discrete objects like words or tokens into continuous vectors (embeddings), we enable language models to analyze and manipulate the relationships between them more effectively, as continuous representations allow for mathematical operations and similarity measures that can capture the semantic and syntactic relationships between words.
          * Embeddings are a powerful way to represent language because they capture both the semantic meaning and syntactic relationships between words. By converting words into embeddings, a language model can perform mathematical operations on these vectors to analyze and manipulate text, enabling tasks such as translation, summarization, and question-answering.
            * what is semantic meaning and syntactic relationships between words?
              * In short, semantics is about the meaning of words and their relationships, while syntax focuses on the structure and arrangement of words in sentences.
                * Semantic meaning: This refers to the meaning or the concept that a word, phrase, or sentence conveys. Semantics is concerned with understanding the meaning behind words and how they relate to each other in terms of their concepts. For example, the words "cat" and "dog" are semantically related because they both represent animals, while the words "apple" and "bicycle" are semantically unrelated because they represent different concepts.
                * Syntactic relationships: Syntax is the set of rules governing how words are combined to form sentences in a language. It deals with the structure and arrangement of words and phrases in sentences. Syntactic relationships refer to how words relate to each other in terms of their positions and roles within a sentence. For example, in the sentence "The cat chased the dog," the syntactic relationship between "cat" and "chased" indicates that the cat is the subject performing the action of chasing, while the relationship between "chased" and "dog" indicates that the dog is the object being chased.
        * what are dimensions in the context of vectors?
          * The term "dimension" can refer to different things in different contexts, which might be causing confusion here. Let me clarify:
            * One-dimensional array: When we say a vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers, it means that the data is organized in a single row or a single column. In this context, "one-dimensional" refers to the structure of the data itself.
            * Dimensions of a vector: When we talk about the dimensions of a vector, we refer to the number of components or elements in the vector. The term "dimension" in this context indicates the length of the vector, or the size of the one-dimensional array.
            * For example, consider a vector with three components: [x, y, z]. This vector is still a one-dimensional array because the data is organized in a single row. However, it is a three-dimensional vector because it has three components or elements (x, y, and z), which correspond to three dimensions or axes in a coordinate space.
      * Positional Encoding: Since transformers don't have a built-in sense of position or order, positional encodings are added to the embeddings. This helps the model understand the sequence and position of words in the input text.
        * questions
          * what do you mean by "encodings" here?
            * GPT answer: In the context of transformers, "encodings" refer to a set of numerical values that are added to the word embeddings (i.e., the vector representations of words) in order to provide information about their position in the sequence.
            * my summary: so just scalars in the vector array. And we know each scalar represents a feature, so makes sense. This feature has to do with position in sequence. Order/categorization. 
          * what do you mean by "sequence and position of words in the input text"? like what does "position or order" even mean for a transformer? is this sometimes built-in in other architectures?
            * GPT answer:
              * The concept of "position or order" refers to the idea that the order of words in a sequence can have a significant impact on the meaning of the overall text. For example, the sentence "I love you" has a very different meaning from "You love I."
              * However, transformers do not have a built-in mechanism to understand the order or position of words in a sequence. They treat each input token independently without considering their position in the sequence. This is where positional encodings come in - they provide a way to inject information about the position of words into the embeddings so that the model can better understand the sequence and position of words in the input text.
              * Other architectures, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have a built-in sense of order because they process the input sequence one token at a time, in order. This allows RNNs to capture sequential dependencies and understand the order of words in the input text without the need for positional encodings.
      * Attention Mechanism: The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input when making predictions. It calculates a weighted sum of the input tokens, with more important tokens receiving higher weights.
      * Layers and Heads: Transformers have multiple layers and attention heads that work together to process the input. Each layer is composed of a multi-head attention mechanism and a [[feed-forward neural network]]. The attention heads within a layer work in parallel, allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input simultaneously.
      * Output: The final layer generates a probability distribution over the possible output tokens. The model selects the token with the highest probability as its prediction and converts it back into text.
    * In summary, transformer architecture in LLMs is a way to process and understand language data by tokenizing text, using positional encodings, applying attention mechanisms, and utilizing layers and heads to generate output. This design has proven highly effective in tasks like translation, summarization, and conversation generation.
      * in transformer architecture, are all features of embeddings just positional encodings?
        * no, there are both word embeddings and the positional encodings. I think key is that features come from both those things together and word embeddings are not made up of position encodings. However, it is true that there is only one type of encoding and that is positional (with some small exceptions)
        * The positional encodings are added to the word embeddings using a fixed mathematical formula that takes into account the position of each token in the sequence. This allows the Transformer to distinguish between tokens that have the same meaning but appear in different positions in the sequence.
        * Together, the word embeddings and positional encodings make up the input embeddings that are fed into the Transformer encoder.
  * noteworthy stuff
    * Elon: autoregressive transformers are very memory-bandwidth intensive
  * anecdotes
    * Elon: AGI will be mix of transformers and diffusions
  * questions
    * difference in transformers and diffusion models?
      * transformers are an LM architecture. Diffusion seems to be a model itself maybe?? idk
      * GPT4
        * Diffusion models excel in tasks like image and audio generation, while transformers are a cornerstone in NLP and are expanding into other areas.
        * Diffusion models work by reversing a process of adding noise to data, whereas transformers use attention mechanisms to process and generate sequential data effectively.
