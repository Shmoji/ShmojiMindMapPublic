  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Today i felt exhausted and couldnt focus on a thing. Made it super hard to work. Even tried 2 power naps. Felt exhausted but also hyper inside mind. Salt did nothing. MagGlycinate did nothing. Pitchfork from Farmside Cafe with chicken did nothing. However, i ate goat cheese and then felt better. So maybe something in that made me feel better. Possible things: (vitamin A, Riboflavin/vitamin B2, Calcium, Phosphorus, Copper, Iron, Selenium, niacin/vitamin B3, maybe some probiotic)

    * [x] desire project - only target my desires. do not need backend. Use desire project to accomplish interactive stream goal.
      * brainstorming
        * store using global context and localstorage
        * use useQuery or whatever IM uses for apis
        * Goal 1 - object
          * convoHistory - array of objects
          * main desire - object
          * context of options and plans (history) - array of object
          * blockers (history) - array of objects
            * blocker 1
            * blocker 2
      * what to fetch from GPT after 1st user input:
        * the main desire
        * Users current plans to achieve goal
        * the blockers
      * GPT's response:
        * Before it understand
          * GPT will list what it understood your main desire to be.
          * GPT will list its understanding of your current plans and options being considered.
          * GPT will list its understanding of your blockers
          * GPT will then ask if it understood correctly. It will mention it cannot help until it understands the 3 above completely. If anything, just need main desire and blockers.
        * After user confirms that GPT understands
          * GPT will give options to continue forward for each blocker and i guess from there, each blocker is basically a separate GPT convo. Just typical convo??
      * things to store
        * convo history
        * the main desire (complex desire)
        * users current plans/options/what you know
        * what is blocking user from achieving desire
      * my desire
        * I want to find way to hookup my discord server as an interactive experience with my Twitch stream.
        * I don't have super precise details, but I am thinking about giving people in the community some sort of persistence. For example, they can track how many streams of mine they have popped into. Or I can create commands they can type into chat...but not sure on details.
        * I am blocked from achieving this goal because:
        * 1) I'm not sure the best way to implement this. I think storing data in MongoDB is best due to my experience with it. I think using an express.js is best due to my experience with it. 
        * 2) im not sure what the most fun and interactive options i can offer people in the community is. I listed a few vague ideas above, but not sure they are good enough
        * 3) im uncertain of how much implementing this idea would cost me. I think i need to pay for MongoDB and AWS ec2 instance, but not sure if that's it or best options.
    * [x] try to put all roam or Evernote in file and make Qanda with algovera and ask questions about self
