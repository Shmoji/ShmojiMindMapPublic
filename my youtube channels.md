  * Shmoji
    * My social channel
    * I will put podcasts here
    * I will put me talking about current events and thoughts about them (maybe better for Life of Shmoji). If podcasting goes well, then maybe ill just leave the podcasts.
  * Life of Shmoji
    * If something connects deeply with my life, ill post it here. Usually something ive experienced a lot
  * Shmoji Posts Anything
    * i put stuff here that doesnt fit into any category. Or stuff that just doesnt seem very good. But not stuff that is 100% spam (like a novelty-less coding stream)
  * Shmoji Spam
    * i put stuff here that is basically spam. Like streams where nothing significant happened
