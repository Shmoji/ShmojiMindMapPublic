      * insight 1: keeping current identity of symbols AND holding identity that is totally away from symbols that automates symbols. I think doing this can be hard to know if holding latter at all. Super easy and is default to hold current identity. So it makes the symbol-less identity feel shiny
      * insight 2: noticing the desire to not identify as a specific symbol is a symbol added (desire). Noticing a certain symbol as bad is added symbol (judgement).
