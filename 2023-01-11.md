      * I was interested in the innovation for a few years. Then, one day decided I wanted a job in it, so I asked in my favorite project's discord if they were hiring devs and they were. They said if I could implement wallet connection on the website then I'd get the job. I had never done that before at that time in 2020, but it was no problem. 

Since then, I've spent about 2 years building https://ideamarket.io - from maintaining Ethereum nodes, maintaining and creating subgraph nodes, building entire frontends on multiple domains, building smart contracts, integrating smart contracts, building database structure, NFTs, and more.

That's basically my professional experience. Aside from that, I've spent a lot of time diving into other web3 projects. Often that involved building something with their technology and interacting with their community. I love the spirit of people trying to do true good in the world through innovation, it's invigorating.

  * [[Log of Ideamarket actions]]
    * Got rid of onchainListingsTrigger webjob
    * Got rid of web3ToWeb2 webjob
    * Got rid of locking webjob, whatever that is (it said successfully deleted, but i still see it lol)
    * Got rid of SyncIMPosts webjob. Think this was for old Posts before NFT metadata used
    * Got rid of SyncPostsCitedBy webjob. It was erroring out anyways, so didn't need it running every 5 minutes.
    * Got rid of old infura endpoint, so possible that subgraph nodes need the new endpoint to get updated data
