        * rainmaker1973: starlink will mark progressive reduction of all this cabling, which started in 1850s (not for the internet, clearly). ME: why did these cables start in 1850s?
          * for [[telegraph]]s
            * The first transatlantic cable was made in 1858. the laying of the west end of the first transatlantic cable was completed when the ship Niagra anchored at the Newfoundland coast having laid 1,016 miles of cable
  * hardware, infrastructure
    * 99% of the internet network runs through submarine cables. There are over 420 submarine lines in the world, totalling 1.3 million km, over 3 times the distance from Earth to Moon.

    * Musk in response to above point: Except for Starlink, which communicates via space lasers. Light travels ~40% faster in vacuum than fiber optics and on a more direct path, rather than following the outline of continents, so Starlink will be much faster over time than ocean cables. This is important.
