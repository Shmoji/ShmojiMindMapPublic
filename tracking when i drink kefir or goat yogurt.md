      * drank kefir at lunch. Then right after, 1) mucus started down throat for entire rest of day 2) kept sneezing 3) nose got stuffed up 5-6/10
      * The above point could be due to food i ate tho. I ate bone broth, sauerkraut, 2 boiled eggs, brown rice 
      * Did not have these symptoms before lunch

      * Ate goat kefir after dinner. I got a lil gassy, felt a bit more bloated. Could have been dinner itself tho. Some sausage pork eggplant meal from work 
      * no nose or mucus issues right after.
