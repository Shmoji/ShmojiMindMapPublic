  * i will use this as journal and solid notes will be stored in [[Unreal engine]]
  * tracking learnings relative to unity
    * tracking learnings about what would be global variables in unity

        * i think all global variables will be defined inside blueprints in unreal. Often near pins and whatnot - so often hard to see

        * so some variables are defined the way i explained in last note - but those arent global vars. Gonna doc how to make those here: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/Unreal engine#^wIfUhooA9|how to create global variables where you define value in editor like you see in Unity]]

      * Rob helped me debug surreal teleporter functionality. You can change text color and use some print string fx to print to screen. You can also detach pins and see if crash or bug is still happening. Sometimes you will only look for these things to happen when some event happens (like player colliding with teleporter) - so same type of debugging as usual tbh - just new ui for me
