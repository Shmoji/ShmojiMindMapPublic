      * what dis?
        * Routing Traffic Through Tor: When you enable this option in Trezor Suite, all of the application's internet traffic will be directed through the [[tor network, the onion router]]. This includes any data exchange between your computer and Trezor's servers or any other online service you interact with through Trezor Suite.
        * Increased Privacy and Security: By using Tor, your online activity, including transactions and wallet addresses, becomes much harder to trace back to you. This adds a layer of privacy and security, especially important in the context of cryptocurrency transactions, which are otherwise public and traceable on the blockchain.
        * Potential Delays: The trade-off for this increased privacy and security is speed. Because your internet traffic is routed through multiple servers around the world, it can take longer for data to travel between your computer and its final destination. This is why the message warns that "Tor may take a while to load and initiate a connection."
