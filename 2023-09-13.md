  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Lil at end of workday had chronic muscle weakness, especially in forearms. Also, general pain around body was about 4/10 - especially in entire spine and neck. Only out of ordinary things: 1) ate a lot of dark chocolates 2) came back home from dad's house today 3) ate some soup from Cristina but dont know all ingredients
    * Ate piece of cake after dinner and pretty quickly my nose got stuffed up and crackly and drainage down throat. Crazy how just 1 tiny piece did that
