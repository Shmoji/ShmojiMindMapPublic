    * No evidence of T lymphocyte response to the antigens tested. These are not currently inflammation-producing infections.

    * These results show that you are excreting mycotoxins in the urine, indicating that you are or have been exposed to mold. Mycotoxins can have a suppressive effect on the immune system, and some can impair hormone balance. Please remember that these results show what is coming out of your body and doesn't necessarily reflect your total body load. I commonly see an increase in certain mycotoxins as treatment begins to work and detoxification pathways improve. Trichothecenes and Zearalenone are usually the last mycotoxins the body excretes and will often rise towards the end of treatment.
    * Evidence of yeast overgrowth and possible excessive gut bacteria, including some clostridia.
    * High oxalates
    * High ketones and fatty acid oxidation
    * High salicylates
    * Some people find that restricting oxalates and salicylates in their diet can be helpful. The fungal colonization/overgrowth can be treated pharmaceutically (ask your PCP) or with herbal and dietary protocols. Read about candida treatments.
