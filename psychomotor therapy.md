  * what is it?
    * me: learned from Body Keeps the Score - it is therapy where you use objects or real people (structures) as your TRUE person from past and then use objects or real people as the IDEAL version of that person from past. Allows to explore your inner reality in the external world. Allows us to "rescript" inner experience
  * key terms
    * structures - explained above
      * what do they allow?
        * Body Keeps the Score: the structures in psychomotor therapy hold out the possibility of forming virtual memories that live side by side with painful realities of the past and provide sensory experiences of feeling seen, supported, etc - that can serve as antidotes to memories of hurt and betrayal
        * Body Keeps the Score: harness the power of the imagination to transform the inner narratives that drive and confine our functioning in the world. The 3 dimensional nature of the structure transforms the hidden, the forbidden, and the feared - into the visible, concrete reality
  * interesting notes
    * comparing with [[ifs]]
      * Body Keeps the Score: IFS calls of the split-off parts that you created in order to survive and enables you to identify and talk with them, so that your undamaged Self can emerge. In contrast, a structure creates a 3D of whom or what you had to deal with and gives you a chance to create a different outcome
