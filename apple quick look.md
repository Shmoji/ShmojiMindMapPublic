        * it apparently allows you to view webXR apps - but idk what it actually is
        * i think some other webXR apps are viewable in AVP, but are blurry and terrible. Quicklook is good tho. Heard this from George
  * what is it?
    * Needle site:
      * USD, which stands for Universal Scene Definition, is a format developed by Pixar similar to Gltf. There are more variants, such as USDA, USDC but the most efficient for our use is USDZ.
      * Apple’s quicklook is an application to preview files such as photos, pdfs and other popular formats. On iOS it also supports AR experience with that USDZ scene.
      * And since the software that is displaying and controlling that USDZ is not our application, there’s a natural limit that you can’t execute any code to control how that scene behaves. Luckily there is a limited API to animate and move objects.
