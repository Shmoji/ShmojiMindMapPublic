      * often after coming out of a deep dive into a technology or a coding session - i find myself disorientated. My social skills have decreased by a lot. My ability to have fun has decreased by a lot. I always wonder what causes that. Maybe going too hard towards a goal?
      * the above was X post and many amazing and novel replies came. Trying to find out how to process them in way that will be valuable and stick.
      * me: i wonder what happens when you go into a social situation right after a long collapsed awareness state. Maybe you just dont take in as much information (bc you were previously limiting/focusing in on specific info) and that can hinder your social abilities
        * good response from cube_flipper: tunnel vision, like trying to socialise while peering through a cardboard tube. eye contact is overwhelming, all my anxiety comes back
