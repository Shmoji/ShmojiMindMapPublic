    * Why does swishing/gargling warm salt water and vinegar help with infection of mouth/tooth/throat/tonsils?
      * Error correction: salt is good, but vinegar is not
      * [[Salt]]
        * Warm salt water works because it is a hypertonic solution. This mean that the osmotic difference between the solution and the tissues is such that it will pull water OUT of the infected tissues. These infected tissues will have excess water/fluids ([[Edema]]) in it (due to inflammation process) and the hypertonic solution will calm it down by pulling out the water, allowing it to thin down and not be so "angry". Salt also acts as a mild disinfectant because the salt solution does the same pulling out water process to any bacteria cells that are around. This can kill bacteria or prevent spread.
        * Sodium chloride or salt is pH neutral so it's unlikely to cause any problems with your teeth.
      * [[Vinegar]]
        * Acetic acid (a.k.a. white vinegar) can act as a disinfectant that can destroy some bacteria and viruses. Studies confirming vinegar's antibacterial properties: Household natural sanitizers like lemon juice and vinegar reduced the number of pathogens to undetectable levels.
        * Vinegar is good for your health, but terrible for your teeth. It's still an acid, ph level of ~2.6, which is equivalent to Coca Cola. You should never swish it around or use it as a rinse
        * Do not try to boil vinegar or heat it up. At high temperatures concentrated acetic acid will become corrosive and can burn through metal and rock.
        * More in-depth why vinegar is bad for teeth
          * The reason it's such a bad idea is that enamel demineralizes in a low pH environment. That means it gets much weaker and is much more prone to erosion and cavitation. In fact, the reason that plaque causes cavities (long story short) is that plaque creates an acidic microenvironment on the surface of your teeth where it is present. This plus other bacterial processes eats away at your enamel, causing a cavity.

However, rinsing with vinegar would be more like bulimia in its effect instead of cavities, affecting your entire mouth. The rinsing action would wash away some of the plaque, but again, the low pH enviornment would weaken and wear enamel. You'd soon find your teeth eroding very quickly.

Rinses that protect your teeth generally do so in part by raising the pH of your mouth, keeping it at a level that allows enamel to remineralize and stay mineralized. Think basic substances like baking soda or even just substances around neutral pH.

There's a lot that can be said about oral pH, but long story short, think vinegar rinse = effects like bulimia.
    * Should you use table salt or Epsom salt for fighting infections?
      * They are 2 totally different compounds. No similarities from what i see

  * What is an infection?
    * An infection is different from inflammation in that it occurs via the invasion of an organism (virus, bacteria, fungi, or parasites) that enters the body and causes issues. Itâ€™s an exterior entry and growth of the organism.
