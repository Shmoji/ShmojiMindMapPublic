  * tracking thoughts on sibo
    * [[2023-12-18]]
      * Jeremiah told me of his friend that has sibo bad. Showed me pic of when this guy gets it bad he becomes pregnant even tho skinny. He has to go to hospital each time and go on all liquid diet to fix everytime.

  * what is sibo
    * not an infection. Bacteria/yeast/both that are causing issue could belong in colon in healthy way - but they never pass to colon
    * you dont have working [[Migrating Motor Complex MMC]] which doesn't specifically empty the small bowel into the colon (like Karen said), but it prepares the way for effective transit when food comes in (almost same thing). This fosters overgrowth of bacteria that shouldnt be there in small intestine
    * These overgrown bacteria digest fiber, steal food from colon bacteria - causes unhealthy microbiome - produces gas, bloating, etc
  * how to defeat SIBO or signals that should make you feel better if you have SIBO
    * eating low FODMAP should make you feel better
    * 3 options to start journey to defeat sibo:
      * GENERAL: basically gotta kill bacteria in small bowel
      * 1: antibiotic called Xifaxan (check if insurance covers without prior authorization in call). Take bile with antibiotic (bc sometimes sibo ppl have bile issues). Antibiotic just works in small bowel. Doesnt get into bloodstream like normal antibiotics. Very expensive bc not FDA approved. $1200-1500 without insurance for 42 pills.
        * let know how doing on day 12 - bc then need to do extra x time if still having same symptoms
        * after finishing treatment need to go on FODMAP diet Karen sent to me (this is case for each option)
      * 2: herbal: burberine, oregano, thyme, sage oil - 6 week course. Works just as well. $300-400.
      * 3: elemental diet. No patients of hers used this in years. All nutrients broke into elements. Expensive. Hard to do. Just eat supplements is what it sounds like and no other food.
  * tests for it
    * does your stomach growl?
      * if stomach does not growl that is sign of SIBO. This is because your Migrating Motor Complex is not working. You know SIBO treatment is working if you start getting stomach growl. Most often happens in morning. You can notice it bc it's a sound that lasts few seconds. Stomach growling (but not gas) and feeling in UPPER abdomen.
    * sibo breath test
      * measures levels of hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide in breathe
      * can give signal that you have SIBO or IMO or something else
      * many dont trust this test
  * related
    * [[me in relation to sibo]]
    * [[small intestine]]
