  * what is it?
    * m for mammal. TOR = target of rapamycin.
    * A longevity gene that makes a protein that senses amino acids.
    * When you eat steak, mTOR activity is activated and mTOR says "I've got lots of protein, i'm gonna make muscle. going to burn energy". That's why you build lot of muscle from eating steak. BUT this is actually not a good thing. You want mTOR levels LOW (in terms of longevity in 2022 at last). When you have low mTOR activity, that's when you get longest lifespan. Mice when given a drug called rapamycin (used to suppress immune system) in low doses, live MUCH longer. LOW activity of mTOR is a sign that times are tough - not enough food - hunker down and build stronger body. Not just for mice, if you give rapamycin to yeast cell, fly, or worm, they all live longer
    * SUMMARY: responds to amino acids
