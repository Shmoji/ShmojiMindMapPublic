    * yesterday i had lil sausages, toast, tomato basil soup, and spicy chili. Before chili i had a few bottom-left foot spasms. Right after eating chili, started having bunch of same spasms

    * Woke up this morning to bottom-left foot spasms and many more around body on arms and stomach, etc. Mainly only foot stayed consistent.
    * Woke up with right nostril almost completely blocked. It has been incredibly clear for days or weeks before this. Hasn't been this blocked in months tbh. This is an old issue i conquered. What caused all this?
    * My guesses: 1) gluten from toast 2) something in tomato basil (doubt it) 3) something in chili 4) both gluten and chili bc i know my stomach doesn't like both gluten and spicy

    * I've had toast before and been mostly fine minus bloating, so I'm guessing it's more due to spicy
