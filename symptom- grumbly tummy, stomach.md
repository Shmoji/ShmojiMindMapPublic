You could literally hear gut creaking and squealing. Sometimes it felt like gas and would hurt for second before noise and then release. Makes me think not kidney pain and is gut pain ^MzRZijKcW]]

      * when i got home from xmas from dad's - and i layed on back at night, tummy started growling like crazy - but then it went away
      * but then today it came back. Tonight intensity was 4-5/10 and even some pain from what felt like gassy pressure maybe. Often the grumble would end with pressure releasing in tummy.
      * my only guesses for cause 1) i ate 2 eggs from home chickens 2) i ate sibo moes bowl (i doubt this one) 3) something else
