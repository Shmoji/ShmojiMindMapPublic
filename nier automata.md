        * do NOT want to get hit by spinning i-frame enemies. They kill v quickly, so just stay away. However, due to chaos of screen, i noticed it's hard to even tell enemy is doing arm spin - so many things in the way
        * faced a giant boss robot and just reminded me that sometimes you just gotta play superrr defensive or youll get stunned and 1 shot
        * also you can only save at rare checkpoints, so more incentive to play defensive. you also may lose your chips
      * [[2024-07-24]]
        * press Y with 9S and you can hack basically any machine woah
        * if you jump light attack you can stun enemies in air, beat them up in air, and then crash down on them. Sometimes even works for bosses. But as always getting close can be risky
    * tracking thoughts on story A
      * [[2024-04-20]]
        * im just trying to remember. basically you've met bad machines, good machines that have disconnected from networks, bad androids created by aliens - and aliens are now dead bc their androids killed them. You are androids created by humanity. Humans live on moon and fight machines on earth i think, using their androids. They escaped to moon long ago when aliens showed up i think.
      * [[2024-06-30]]
        * you face machine named Adam. Is this one of the 2 you face before? He kidnapped 9S after he was blasted away by explosion of giant machines you fought
        * is Adam human-originating?
          * Perplexity: Adam was not created by aliens directly, but rather by machine lifeforms that were originally created by aliens. The sequence of events is as follows: ^U2a6QnTA_
            * Aliens invaded Earth and initially faced resistance primarily from Emil (a character from the first NieR game).
            * After being overwhelmed by Emil and his clones, the aliens retreated and created machine lifeforms to fight on their behalf. They did this approximately 12 years after arriving on Earth, using factories left over from the previous game[ðŸ”—](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/168677-nier-automata/78011776).
            * At some point, the machine lifeforms gained sentience and rebelled against their alien creators, destroying them.
            * The machines then began to evolve on their own, driven by a fascination with humanity. This fascination likely stems from their accidental fusion with data from the Gestalt project, which contained extensive information about humans[ðŸ”—](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/168677-nier-automata/78011776).
            * Adam was created when a group of these sentient machine lifeforms fused together temporarily to form a "mini factory" to create him[ðŸ”—](https://www.reddit.com/r/nier/comments/qn2d5d/how_did_the_machines_create_adam/).Â He represents a significant evolutionary leap for the machines, being a highly-advanced AI designed to understand and imitate humanity
          * actually you see Adam birthed when bunch of machines come together. Then another comes out of him after you stab him...is that Eve? (i think so)
      * [[2024-07-14]]
        * oh wow just finished the abandoned factory and if you havent already, you end this mission at the first place you ever died at beginning of game - which allows you to get your original greatsword and other items
        * before this abandoned factory mission you fight and kill Adam. After factory mission, it shows Eve v angry about bro being killed
      * [[2024-07-19]]
        * just finished first ending of game. felt i liked Replicant better. this story wasn't as intimate and engaging. But combat is maybe better
        * oo i only finished ending A and didnt realize the next endings are totally new content. maybe my mind will change
    * tracking thoughts on story B
      * [[2024-07-24]]
        * confirmed that at beginning, resistance camp reports weird machine activity in desert, you go there. Then bunch of talking machines come together to create Adam. You almost kill Adam and then Eve comes out of him. Fully robots
      * [[2024-07-25]]
        * lots of new awesome scenes and fighting
        * so it seems alot of 9S combat is about hacking and playing lil mini-games to hack
        * already new scene from big singing lady machine, new scene from Adam and Eve talking, and scene of i think your pods sharing data between 9S and 2B which i didnt understand
      * [[2024-07-27]]
        * there was one bland NPC that said something about getting no response from the moon when they messaged about news about aliens...now im wondering: 1) maybe humans on moon are dead or 2) maybe humans on moon already knew and there's some bigger conspiracy related to androids and humans not wanting to deal with them...or something (have them kill selves fighting machines)
      * [[2024-08-06]]
        * Pascal says something about violent machines in the Forest Kingdom which you get to through the commercial district. You go there and machines are talking about a king and protecting it at a castle in the forest. Ends up there was a robot king that eventually died, but they put its memories into small baby robot and that was now the king
        * in story B, once you get to the king, female android named A2 shows up by stabbing through the king. You have to fight here but she gets away. Says Command is bad guy
        * i swear you dont see A2 in first playthrough, but according to few LLM searches - they said you do
        * since from perspective of 9S, after fighting big machine from ocean - 9S crashes missile into machine. After this, 9S body disappears and doesnt show up until 2B kills Adam in the copy world. But it seems part of 9S became part of the machine network somehow after the blast
        * seems 9S rests up and 2B is at the arc at the factory 
      * [[2024-08-08]]
        * why are project gestalt archives in the factory 2B is at and 9S hacks into?
        * well shoot, Commander saw you left trail when accessing the Moon's servers, so she spills the beans bc everyone needs a god to fight for she says
        * basically, humanity was already dead when aliens attacked Earth. So no humans are on moon. Council of Humanity was setup by YorHa. Only thing on moon is a server and it contains some of the human genome
        * same thing happened at ending B - basically 9S consciousness uploaded to machine network. He mentioned it was interesting having multiple selves merge into one
        * at very ending of this ending B you see 2 hologram girls - who the heck is that?
        * it finished with 2B and 9S being back at bunker...i wonder if this 9S is still connected to machines or doesnt have any of those memories from that self..
        * i think in ending A, Pascal's village is all killed, but i dont think that's the case in this ending, but idk
    * tracking thoughts on story C
      * [[2024-08-08]]
        * seems 9S still hasnt told 2B about humanity when next big battle on Earth starts. That's how this one starts - since Adam and Eve leaders are killed, androids do all out attack to take earth back from machines
        * some machines EMP them and then you hack 2B to try and fix it bc all B models are screaming in pain. Right after that, all B models except 2B start attacking you and laughing. 9S and 2B upload their data and explode their black boxes. Now they are back at the Bunker.
      * [[2024-08-10]]
        * virus spreads to all androids except 2B, 9S, A2. Bunker lost. 2B gets infected and dies and gives her memories to A2 i think. 9S thinks A2 just killed 2B with ill intentions and then he falls into valley. You have to choose to help A2 or 9S - i assume you can do other story later - i chose A2.
        * some structures come from underground - they look alott like Adam's copy world
      * [[2024-08-11]]
        * A2 got EMPed by some desert machine. her memories were merged with the enemy machine, 2B, and her own of course. She killed some shadowy figure saying "mama" in her memories.
        * after this you get to continue choosing to monitor A2 or 9S. i chose 9S. you wake up to Devola and Popola who saved you and ur in resistance camp
      * [[2024-08-14]]
        * 9S destroys core of some resource structure of the machines in Forest of the King. this gives him a key. Machine was begging for help and 9S no care - and swear i heard 2B voice just before he killed core of machine
        * ur pod detects bad internal signals in 9S and collabs with other pod to keep A2 away 
        * you choose again and i choose 9S again
      * [[2024-08-15]]
        * at flooded city at resource recovery unit, 9S finds logs on project YorHa - they say the androids blackbox uses same machine core as machines - and also that they didnt use "standard ai" bc the androids were meant to be disposed and it was unethical to...interesting
        * 9S hacks core of big machine and sees all his memories of 2B. they then start getting deleted by dark cubes. he defeats dark cube monster, but then as he repeatedly stabs it, it becomes 2B...huh?
        * you then monitor A2 again with no choice for 9S. Pods talk about 9S mental health again. One pod has some speech issues..hm weird
      * [[2024-08-16]]
        * machines in Pascal's village started eating each other. Leftovers killed themselves out of fear. You delete Pascal's memories as he wishes.
      * [[2024-08-18]] Gestalts, Replicants. Black Scrawl, Relapses, Shades #memo
        * once you finally get in the machine tower with help of Devola and Popola - you instantly get access to their memories or logs. Tells story of Project Gestalt and how the original gestalt is lost due to the twins from Nier Replicant - but many towns had the twin models - those ones just happened to lose it and kill humanity by losing og gestalt. Then, all other androids started hating the twin models. The models had their memories wiped eventually and programmed to always generate guilt
        * Q: in neir universe, do replicants reproduce? can they be cloned?
          * replicants in the NieR universe cannot reproduce biologically, but they can be "cloned" or recreated by the Overseer androids using stored genetic data.
          * Q: but replicants can die. do they just get cloned and that new clone works for gestalt or does each gestalt have one replicant and if it dies then so does gestalt?
            * the death of a Replicant does not directly cause the death of its Gestalt. Instead, new Replicant bodies can be created for each Gestalt, with the real threat being the relapse of the Gestalt itself. If a Gestalt relapses, it loses sentience and can no longer be reunited with a Replicant body (altho no proof it could in ideal scenario)
        * it talked about the beginning when replicants became conscious/self-aware - the Black Scrawl appeared, and Relapses began
        * gestalts are the soul stored of humans. replicants are the leftover zombie bodies - that's my understanding
        * my understanding is that the genetics of the former bodies of gestalts determines if relapses happen. BUT also if the replicants of that gestalt become sentient, that ALSO leads to relapses. When this happens - gestalts become hostile shades and cant reunite with their replicant bodies - causing both to die - the Replicant specifically gets the Black Scrawl
        * okay i think i got clarified:
          * Genetic instability: Gestalts, which are separated souls of humans, can become unstable over time. this is due to degradation of the Gestalt's data which the data is genetics basically (for many reasons - physical, mental, spiritual, emotional). This is relapse and stable connection between Gestalt and Replicants are lost and causes both to die. Gestalts turn to shades and replicants get black scrawl (before shades, stable gestalts are just stored and chilling - waiting to return to replicants which are the vessels)
          * Replicant sentience: well the vessels become conscious, so obviously the gestalts cant return - it's a conflict - which leads to more instability and eventual relapse
        * oh also i think it was a combo of all alive Devola and Popola models (including from Automata) that sent remaining human/gestalt data to the moon. Mainly genome data. Also sent data on replicants - which pretty much was that genome data. At many points it mentions Council of Humanity in terms of this server, but that's just bc they used humans alive on moon as a fake God - but it was D and P that sent it. Crazy enough, this server/data could be "the Cage" server that makes up entire universe of Nier Reincarnation
      * [[2024-08-21]]
        * i chose A2. it seems she dies at tower after saving 9S. Then it shows 2B's sword in a rock
        * learned 2B was actually 2E...much improved model made to kills 9S models i guess?
        * The Tower was apparently meant to destroy the moon..maybe bc of the supposed human server there. 9S said that was fake meant to encourage androids to think humanity is alive, but Devola and Popola story said they did send the data there...
    * story D and E
      * [[2024-08-22]]
        * you choose 9S and him and A2 kill each other
        * you find out the Tower is launching an ark to another planet
        * 9S gets to choose to go or not
        * this may be story E now, but the 2 pods give decision to delete all data or keep it. Pods seem to have consciousness. All YorHa now ded and pods were supposed to delete all data at that point.. but they refuse
        * you can choose to save a player in credit shooter (have them cheat) if you delete all your save data
        * EDIT: i guess these credits are ending E
    * story thoughts once done
      * [[2024-08-22]]
        * humans didn't even fight the aliens. humans died to the White clorination syndrome from drakengard and nier replicant.
        * Emil cloned himself a crap ton to fight the aliens
        * did Giant or dragon at beginning of Replicant cause White Clorination Syndrome that ends humanity?
          * In the NieR universe, White Chlorination Syndrome (WCS) is caused by the magical particles, known as Maso, released by the Giant. These particles force humans to make a choice: join with a god from another dimension and become a Legion, or refuse and turn into a pillar of salt. The Dragon's appearance, along with the Giant, marked the beginning of the end for humanity, but it is the Maso from the Giant that directly causes WCS.
        * what are Legions?
          * In the NieR universe, the term "Legion" refers to the collective of humans who are affected by White Chlorination Syndrome (WCS) and choose to serve an otherworldly god. Those who accept this pact become mindless soldiers known as Legion, while those who refuse are turned into pillars of salt. The Legion is led by a commander known as "Red Eye," who organizes and leads these transformed individuals. Doesnt directly control from Drakengard universe - mainly just through WCS
        * did the Dragon and Giant have names?
          * In the NieR universe, the Giant does not have a specific name. It is often referred to simply as the "Giant" or the "Mother Angel" in the context of its appearance alongside the Dragon, Angelus, in Shinjuku, which led to the outbreak of White Chlorination Syndrome. The particles of dragon used to create gestalts and Replicants pretty sure
        * why is giant called Mother Angel
          * The "Mother Angel" is a term used in the Drakengard series to refer to a powerful, statue-like entity that appears in the game's ending. In Drakengard, the Mother Angel is depicted as a gigantic figure with the ability to manipulate 'Great Time' and threatens to destroy the world. This entity is part of the apocalyptic scenario that leads to the events of NieR, where Caim and Angelus confront it, resulting in their fall into an alternate universe in Tokyo, which sets off the chain of events leading to the NieR storyline

      * [[2024-08-29]]
        * just to clarify: 2B was actually 2E - an executioner type specifically made to kill 9S models bc they often discover the truth of YorHa. Many hints of this throughout game. Redhair model in sidequest is also E model
    * just playing after beating game
      * [[2024-09-15]]
        * beat the only DLC. basically 3 different tournaments. Once you beat, you get access to story of Plato 1728 robot that sucked at everything, hated violence, made one friend that was a doll, but it got killed, and he somehow got strength to kill everyone around him - friend and foe. He lived on as memories after that. You get to see music video of dolls being destroyed. Some band gets highlighted alot from this DLC
        * Apparently you get to fight CEO of Square Enix and some other company in this DLC lol
        * i leveled to about 82 by using auto items at place where you fight Adam/Eve in desert. After that i got to 99 by fighting the bunny statue in Amusement Park (gave about 2-3 levels per kill) and can just save and reload checkpoint after each kill.
      * [[2024-10-08]]
        * well i got all Steam achievement, finished all endings including DLC, did all quests, and just finished reading all the weapon stories. Those stories were so darn good omg. Well guess im done with this game now!
    * tracking things i need to remember
      * [[2024-06-11]]

    * how to figure out your weapons
      * you can have 2 weapon sets that you can switch between in combat with up on dpad
      * each weapon set has 1 weapon for light attack and 1 weapon for heavy attack [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/nier automata#^m4MCT3jmM|left button is light attack. top button is heavy attack]]
    * how to combo
      * one option: finish light attack combo, do heavy attack combo, back to light attack, etc
      * two option: knock enemy into air, light attack combo, ground slam (guy on YT said good for bosses as way to stop them for a bit)
      * 3: dodge at perfect time, then attack for big damage bb
    *  how to crowd and camera control
      * you want to try and keep all enemies in view, bait them to you, and when chance to attack...attack. This is bc usually you are fighting groups of enemies. Once you land a good hit, if there is chance to isolate enemy then do it - but these are more rare and dont start with taking out enemies one by one when there is group
    * how to knock enemies up into air?
      * jump and immediately do heavy attack
    * how to ground slam
      * jump and then heavy attack, but not immediately
    * how to chips
      * seems like health recovery chips are OP, shock chips are pretty good, and weapon offense are pretty good - i guess use defense if u dyin
    * how to fix default camera
      * in camera settings, put "Vertical Auto Adjust" to 0
  * characters
    * Anemone
      * leader of android resistance on Earth

    * Pascal
      * friendly robot leader from village of robots that disconnected from the network
  * places
    * bunker
      * space station. i think orbiting earth bc you can see earth out window - humans controlling androids at bunker are on moon i think.
      * ran by humans that fled earth due to alien attack
  * questions
    * what are best tips to know?
      * save often - there is no autosave
      * buy TONS of recovery items
      * apparently chips are super important
      * be careful of death. You always want to go back to dead body and recoverold chips. If you die on way back to body, all items are lost
    * how do close-range attacks work?
      * left button is light attack. top button is heavy attack ^m4MCT3jmM
      * you can tap tap tap for one series of moves OR can hold down for different series of moves - you can of course mix all these up - and add jumps in
    * how are heavy sword and spears different?
      * instead of holding heavy attack doing a combo, it does a charged attack
    * should i use charged attacks?
      * sounds like they are risky unless you can and are playing very defensively. And even then, you need to learn to weave them into combos
