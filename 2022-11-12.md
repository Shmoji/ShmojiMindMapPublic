  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Had lil black dots in poop. Was incredibly gassy today after eating beans

    * my guesses for why symptoms got better for like 1-2 days and then got bad again: 1) consumed very low sugar, including natural 2) avoided brown rice 3) maybe cannibus worked for a bit and then stopped idk

    * Pain was 10/10 at Dayglow show tonight. Even had weak muscles
