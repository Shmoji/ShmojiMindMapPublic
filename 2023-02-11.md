    * When do i care about failing?
      * When i have time to think, i love failing. That's how i learn the quickest and best and persists longest

      * However, in most social situations, i seem to have some weird fear of failure. Fear of saying the thing that doesn't add value. Fear of not having anything to say and offering no value. Fear of facial expressions subtracting value.
