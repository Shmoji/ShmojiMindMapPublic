    * I've noticed when i successfully make each moment optimal, i often visually see in my mind's eye an object that represents "the infinite/some layer up like planetary consciousness" combining with an object that represents whatever is task at hand.
    * i find it extremely valuable to observe any issue in moment and realize i have infinite of what i want. So, i want to be funny. it's issue that in past I wasn't. but in this moment, i realize i am the funniest. Everyone loves me and sees me as infinite.
