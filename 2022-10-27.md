  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Woke up to burning all over body and especially in upper-nose and head more intense than previous days. Possible reasons why: 1) i did neck and back workout yesterday 2) when i did back workout, i put nose into carpet that maybe had dust on it 3) ate kimchi yesterday 4) been drinking Ceylon tea errday 5) random
    * Couldn't workout today because overall feeling of 1) burning skin at sinuses and head 2) head pain in whole forehead and whole top of head 3) under jaw/throat swollen and painful #disability-example
    * After about 2pm, my lower stomach started killing me. Mainly feel it from belly button to dick. Felt like gas and indeed multiple poops came out. Even after that, it still was rough enough where i couldn't do anything at all #disability-example
    * Brainstorming: maybe i get constipated by something and then one day it all comes out and doesn't feel good. Maybe exercise caused poop to flow out, since i started that this week. 
    * Have felt cold all day today, wonder if that happens when i have stomach issues.
    * Have felt emotionally bad today. Kinda like looking for way out, which i guess is fear. Stomach issue related?
    * around 8pm, after getting a lot of solid poop out for a few hours, i got some more diarrhea like poop out
