  * NOTE: these are just notes i take while learning meditations - may disperse these elsewhere later
  * attention
    * local binding: the thing you have attention on now is bound to thing in previous moment ^S1xKuiFcw
    * when attention on multiple things, these things synchronize
    * due to above points, you can see how putting attention on something negative can end up bad
    * your inner rhythm will align with what your attention is drawn towards
    * when you focus on on thing, this paints all things youre not paying attention to or are paying attention to in cloudy way
  * energy
    * what you put attention on energizes you. a bland rock will be calm, the concept "something youve never experienced before" will be high energy
    * you can put attention on some thing and then apply sensations of other thing to that (im still a bit confused about this tho - is this annealing?)
    * energy body vs thing you have attention on
  * consonance, disonance, 
    * only thing i got from this is that you can become x thing that is your dissonance and observe everything that is not the dissonance. You can the synchronize dissonance and consonance into one. I have had slight pain relief doing this.
  * Local binding and pagerank of attention

    * you can put attention on inner seeing - outer seeing. Same for all other senses
      * for me, the outer sense always feels physical. The inner feels less physical
      * i noticed when i put attention on inner seeing and especially inner hearing - felt like my mind was sporadically context switching
    * in relation to pain and suffering
      * if you put attention on negative valence inner hearing or negative valence outer feeling - this can then synchronize with other qualia you have attention on and multiply the intensity in a higher dimension -- BUT same can be said for positive valence
    * the witness and the witnessed
      * choose body parts. A is witnessing B and B is witnessing C
        * for me, the witness tends to be forgotten - if that is the witness, it is hard to witness it.
        * in vid, he says that C affects A greatly - but i didnt vibe with that tbh
  * thermodynamics of consciousness and ecosystem of agents
    * all about how all agents of you can be friendly towards each other
    * egregore = concept representing a non-physical entity that arises from the collective thoughts of a distinct group of people
    * experience i had: felt one with nature that is by default emitting love to all subagents - which then allows all subagents to fade
  * High valence calisthenics
    * Started this one in good bit of pain
    * Ended it slightly more relaxed and slightly less pain - which is typical of any meditation
    * Some states I found hard to access without using mind
    * Some states that weren't supposed to be embodied felt at least a bit embodied
    * didn't feel i did a v good job at this meditation lol
    * think learning you can get high valence in all sensations inner and outer is super important. i think learning you can use the "heavens" mentioned and create your own is super important
  * open sourcing God
    * really liked this one
    * you can make God anything
    * what you make God is an axis of annealing (what does this even mean?). I intuitively understand this, but not logically. Best guess is that it causes change in valence/sensation/qualia/mind/etc.
    * At end i tried God of healing and love (and set give/take/everything to God as primary goal) and felt multiple symptoms reduce
  * harmonic meditation - calibration exercises
    * felt like all parts were pretty good, then when it got to the part with torus (didnt even know what that is), but i felt the energy going through spine and around like anime character - and i felt like my body was floating
    * Nearing end i found i was almost falling asleep lol my head kept tipping back and id catch myself - which was weird bc i was quite alert and awake
    * mainly dealing with sinus and head pain of 5/10 today. definitely reduced to like 2/10
    * After meditation, trying to keep those good sensations going while doing tasks is so hard and potentially distracting
    * im not totally sure, but i think it's more helpful to focus on good qualia, than to focus on watching the good qualia overtake the bad qualia (which is basically cope hoping the pain/bad qualia goes away
    * )
  * the phenomenology of ontology
    * 6-7/10
    * ontology = study of being. Ontology addresses questions like how entities are grouped into categories and which of these entities exist on the most fundamental level
    * ontology -> phenomena
    * you can choose any ontology as the ONE and then see what that's like. examples: beliefs are fundamentally everything. Atoms are everything. Information is everything. Energy. Algorithms. Nothingness. etc
    * i honestly kinda zoned out for most of meditation because i got some pain relief when i thought about "matter, space, and consciousness" as separate and then i saw consciousness as large white glowing blob. I focused on glowing blob while pain object was in awareness. Then, transferred bc realized consciousness is not trapped in body. Body is of consciousness. Only got lil pain relief and then somewhat kept chasing most of meditation
