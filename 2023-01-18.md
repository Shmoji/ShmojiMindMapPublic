    * [x] Arg cord: Gotta say, ive really been enjoying Pokemon Scarlett. It's so relaxing. Typically i get stressed in games when the only next thing to do is some deep story-line thing or some challenging task, but due to the open-world aspect, it just feels so relaxing and nice. Often i find myself just hopping around collecting berries and exploring.
