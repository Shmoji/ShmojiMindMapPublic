      * in like 10 minutes after finishing food, i was bloated to hell 4-6/10 and actually didn't even eat the onions  ^vPPZ4-iY3
      * i got weird acid reflux-like feeling that causes coughing which is very rare for me

      * had same bloating thing as last time - more than the hibachi fried rice 4 sure. Also didnt even touch the onions this time. So what about teriyaki sauce causes bloating? ^3wkeKAXp5
      * i looked it up - it could be soy, garlic, or onions - bc those 3 things are all in soy sauce apparently
      * did not get coughing thing this time
      * 5-6/10 bloating this time around
