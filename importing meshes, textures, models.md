        * Rob explained a bunch of how this works. Most made logical sense, but dont feel i could apply it just yet. Will note what i remember

        * tried importing FBX into unreal of owl. Nothing showed up. Imported into Blender and same thing. According to Rob, it was just superrr tiny, so he just scaled it up to fix it.
        * note to self: always check scale when running into import issue
