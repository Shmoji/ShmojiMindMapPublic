  * key realizations from listening to him
    * it's important to choose a binder based on what toxins show in your urine test and any other labs that may be important. Shouldn't just take binder that isn't for what toxins you're dealing with
    * he says marcons treatment has been pointless from his experience 
  * content i consumed from him

  * tracking how i feel about him
    * very intelligent and experienced on rare conditions
    * best, smartest, and most experienced mold (and chronic illness) expert ive listened to
    * i like how he says treatments completely depend on patients. Like he said gotta take certain binders depending on what toxins you have. Diet depends on the person. etc
    * i like that he wont associate himself with drug companies
  * questions
    * is he still treating patients?
      * No, he retired from treating. He is just consulting businesses now
