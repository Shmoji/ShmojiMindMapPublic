  * Histamine process
    * Something bad in body is detected by your immune system, so it launches a chain reaction to defend you.
    * First, it sends a chemical signal to mast cells. The message is "release histamines", which are stored in the mast cells.
    * When they leave the mast cells, histamines boost blood flow in the area of body with issue. This causes inflammation, which lets other chemicals from your immune system step in to do repair work (like WBC i think).
