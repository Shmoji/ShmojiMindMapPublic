    * [[2024-09-28]] Crew-9 launch - Nick Hague and Aleksandr Gorbunov, what rocket, ship, stages, nosecone #[[fast memo]]
      * Falcon-9 rocket. Dragon spacecraft at top (there are multiple versions of Dragon)
      * made Papa watch hehe
      * Q: why did i hear Falcon9 is 2 stage rocket but also hear it has 3 stages?
        * it has 2 primary stages:
          * 1: responsible for initial thrust to break through the atmosphere and provides bulk of lift-off power. Stage that lands back on Earth for reuse
          * 2: this stage takes over after the 1st stage separates, continuing the push to deliver the payload into its desired orbit (usually returned to ocean or burns up in atmosphere completely, but other options being worked on like parachute down for reuse, reuse while still in orbit, or just sending out to space out of way)
        * the 3rd stage is often due to mission-specific configs or additional components. EX:
          * payload mechanisms: sometimes a satellite payload may have its own propulsion system (like for reaching precise orbit). But these are not part of core Falcon9 structure.
          * Dragon Capsule or Starship: in some crewed or cargo missions, the capsule itself may have thrusters or small propulsion system, which may be loosely referred to as 3rd stage - but technically not 3rd stage of rocket
        * so "stages" are basically and traditionally used to provide force using fuel and once fuel is used up (or that stage's goal achieved), that stage is jettisoned/discarded (away from main mission, maybe reused)
      * At very top of Dragon can lift nosecone and have different types of interfaces - 1) cupola (spherical thing to look out) 2) space station docking interface 3) bars to hang on for spacewalks
    * [[2024-10-07]] ESA Hera launch, examining results of DART mission, Didymos, fairing #[[fast memo]]
      * Falcon-9 rocket. Hera satellite on top.
      * DART mission shot asteroid to see effects and test defense against asteroids coming at Earth or our stuff
      * their site: investigate the Didymos binary asteroid, including the very first assessment of its internal properties, and to measure in great detail the outcome of NASA's DART mission kinetic impactor test. Hera will provide extremely valuable information for future asteroid deflection missions and science; increasing our understanding of asteroid geophysics as well as solar system formation and evolutionary processes.
      * in space launches, what is a fairing?
        * me: protective shell
        * protective shell or enclosure that is placed around a spacecraft or satellite during launch. Its primary function is to protect the payload (the spacecraft, satellite, or other cargo) from aerodynamic forces, friction, heat, and contamination during the ascent through Earth's atmosphere
        * Q: is fairing just used for the payload?
          * mainly for payload, but its protection extends to any delicate components attached to the rocket.
        * they are typically jettisoned once no longer needed (after 1st stage usually or MECO) and can be recovered back on Earth (they parachute back down weee)
      * q: is it a spacecraft, a satellite, or both, or neither?
        * primarily referred to as a spacecraft designed for a planetary defense mission. Technically it will orbit the binary asteroid as a satellite once it enters the binary system, but traditionally that label doesnt really work here.
    * [[2024-10-13]] flight 5 of friggin Starship and chopsticks first try! how many stages, location of launch, concern, reason mechazilla and chopsticks so OP #[[fast memo]]
      * Starship has 2 stages. Super heavy booster and the spaceship itself called Starship. Traditionally payloads/crafts arent really considered stages bc not used to propel to an orbit (Dragon is ex despite it having thrusters for maneuvers, but CANNOT get to orbit on its own), but look at all dem engines n shiz on Starship (it can get to orbit even once SH go bye bye)
      * NOTE: Starship can get to orbit from various low-gravity space rocks like moon and Mars, but cant do that from Earth rn. There are theoretical designs thinking about it
      * flew from Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas today (Starfactory is in same complex, u just say SF is at SB)
      * obv u know how it went with chopsticks catching super heavy booster. the spacecraft landed in ocean and then exploded tho. They said they didnt intend to keep it, but seems pretty big deal to me for the thing humans ride in to not explode (but maybe they just werent testing that in this test) - ALTHO, they did very precisely land it in a specific spot despite explosion
      * reason mechazilla and chopsticks so OP: once it is caught, the booster is ready in about 1 hour to fly again (you fuel back up in like 5 minutes and then get it and new payload back in position for remaining time). Eventually Starship will be caught too with another chopsticks
      * NOTE: The booster of Starship, the Super Heavy, is as tall as all of Falcon Heavy! Q: so what is FH? A: it is Falcon9 except 2 strap-on boosters to sides of middle booster that are exactly same as middle one (except no 2nd stage since just boosters). MOAR thrust - which means more payload allowed. And of course they are reusable
    * [[2024-10-14]] Europa Clipper mission, Falcon Heavy, how get there and when, hydrothermal vents #[[fast memo]]
      * watched with Papa. Went up on Falcon Heavy and will send spacecraft to analyze Europa in many different ways
      * spacecraft will travel past Mars Feb 2025 and Earth Dec 2026 and use their gravity to gain velocity needed to reach Europa by 2030
      * EUROPA-EARTH MOON COMPARISON and WATER SIZE: Europa is about same size as Earth's moon (slightly smaller) - yet we think that under its icy surface is 2-3 times more volume of water than all Earth's oceans combined. meme: europa most popular moon, so iz size same as Earth moon...BUT haz more water than all EARTH's water combined
      * BIG OL ROCK DIAMATER SIZES:
        * Europa: about 3100km
        * Earth moon: 3400km
        * Earth: 12700km
        * meme: earth big in this ss, so Earth moon bigger than Europa moon. Easy nums for membin: moon as 1/4 size of Earth makes sense and gets you to about 3000km if round down to 12k for earth. Then stick with 3s for the meme and that is diff between 2 moons: 300km
      * there's signs of hydrothermal vents on Europa and on Earth where those are is much life
    * [[2024-11-19]] flight 6 starship, boostback burn, reentry burn, banana payload #[[fast memo]]
      * boostback burn = applies force so booster can return back to launch site. Reversal of direction from the orbit path
      * Q: But why cant it just go back without the boostback burn, why don't it just come back down?
        * **Horizontal Speed**: After launch, the rocket gains significant horizontal velocity (often several thousand kilometers per hour) in the direction of the orbital path. This velocity is necessary for the upper stage to reach orbit but means the booster is moving away from its launch site at high speed.
        * there's other reasons too but i no memo
      * Q: Does boostback burn move it instantly in opposite direction? Or is it more gradual?
        * gradual.
        * **Preparation**: Before the boostback burn, the booster MIGHT perform a flip maneuver to point its engines in the direction it needs to go (in this case, opposite to its travel). MIGHT bc 1) sometimes full flip isnt needed, only partial 2) some engines can gimbal/tilt allowing JUST engine to change direction (starship does this)
      * it visually looks like straight line moving away from launch site at first (kinda angled tho). After BB, path starts forming curve/arc initially going UP and BACK for lil bit until DOWN to return back to launch site (NOTE: it doesnt return upside down lol)
      * NOTE: even above atmosphere, gravity acc is still about 9.8, so we rely on that to come back down
      * btw no catch happened. Booster landed in Gulf of Mexico and Starship landed in indian ocean after orbiting for like 40 minutes
      * Q: what is difference in boostback burn and reentry burn?
        * boostback burn. i already know what it iz. **Timing**: It occurs RIGHT after the stage separation, when the booster is still in the upper atmosphere or just above it. only lasts like 30 seconds really
        * **Reentry Burn** is primarily to counteract gravity-induced speed as it reenters the denser parts of the atmosphere to prevent overheating and ensure controlled descent. **Timing**: This burn happens after the booster has completed its boostback burn and is descending through the atmosphere, typically around **60-80 km altitude**.
