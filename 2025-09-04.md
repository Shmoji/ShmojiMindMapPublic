- [[Log of health notes]]
	- first visit to primary care doctor Dr Chris Donovin (just goes by Chris) at Shipyard Medical bc he works with medicaid. That place was roughhhh, but he seemed like pretty okay doctor
	- told him my health history. I wanted referralto rheumatology for Sjogrens Syndrome, but he sounded doubtful he could get me in without positive tests of some sorts.
	- He offered to do some blood tests - like ANA, but i cancelled. He maybe scheduled it for later??
	- he felt multiple of my lymph nodes and agreed it not normal for all those to be swollen like that for years. He said that's why neck is so tender
