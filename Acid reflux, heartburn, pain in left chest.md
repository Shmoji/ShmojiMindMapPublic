  * tracking pain in left chest
    * [[2024-09-22]] what causes pain in left chest from a banana? fermentation, FODMAPs, why do gases cause bloating in some - ex of lactose #[[fast memo]]
      * i had not ate food in hours. Then, i ate banana. Few minutes later i stood up and about a minute later while still standing, i got pain in left chest for a few seconds 2-3/10 intensity
      * looked it up and typically bananas are actually good for acid reflux, but for some theyre not - especially those with IBS
      * it seems bananas cause bloating or gas -> these cause increase pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter (valve/gate) -> The pressure can open the valve—when it should remain closed—allowing the backflow of stomach acids, which can trigger heartburn
        * esophagus - muscular tube that moves food/liquids from mouth to stomach (then goes from stomach to small intestine and then to colon)
        * esophageal sphincter:
          * Location: It's located at the lower end of the esophagus, just before it connects to the stomach. looks like it's right under left chest close to middle of body tho (and obv internal)
          * Structure: It's a ring-shaped muscle that acts as a valve.
      * Q: so in this case of eating a banana and the bloating from it triggers acid reflux - what caused the bloating?
        * could be many things:
          * bananas contain fermentable carbohydrates, including FODMAPs like fructans, which can cause gas and bloating in some individuals, particularly those with IBS
          * unripe bananas have high levels of resistant starch, which can ferment in the colon and lead to bloating
          * FODMAPs typically cause symptoms quicker than resistant starch - which mine was quick
        * more ripe/brown = more FODMAPs
        * from this research session my best guess: FODMAPs from banana (fructans and fructose) are not fully digested in small intestine, pass to large intestine/colon, gut bacteria in colon ferment FODMAPs producing gas (hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and sometimes methane gas) which then triggers bloating and gas symptoms you know
        * And then i just accept that these gases go on to cause symptoms (bloating/left chest pain) i have but i have no idea why they do dat to me lol. i guess: the hydrogen or CO2 causes the bloating/inflammation and that is that? which can then trigger the heartburn due to reflux. Q: why can hydrogen and co2 from fermentation of FODMAPs cause bloating in some but not others?
          * MORE GAS PRODUCTION: 1) **gut bacteria**: Some individuals have a higher abundance of specific bacteria that produce more gas during the fermentation of FODMAPs, resulting in bloating. 2) **Gut Motility**: Variations in gut motility (how quickly food moves through the digestive system) can influence how well individuals tolerate FODMAPs. Slower motility may lead to more fermentation in the gut, increasing gas production and bloating. 3) **sensitive** gut/other-system like with IBS 4) **Lack of Digestive Enzymes**: Some individuals may lack the enzymes needed to break down certain FODMAPs (like lactose in lactose-intolerant individuals), resulting in more fermentation by gut bacteria and increased gas production.
          * Enzymes are produced by human cells and gut bacteria (more by gut bacteria). These enzymes break food down to digest it - but it's not fermentation (for lactose breaking down in small intestine). My tummy has these enzymes to digest lactose so it doesnt go to colon and ferment like Sarah. i learned lactose mostly digested in small intestine for healthy ppl - but this is not the case for all FODMAPs
            * Q: for people who have lactose enzymes, these enzymes break the lactose down before it gets to colon and ferments - so these enzymes are not part of fermentation? A: correct - like lactase. They break down stuff for various other reasons. But there are also enzymes used for fermentation too (not these ones tho)
            * do memo on enzymes one day: this will help https://x.com/i/grok/share/YP3s7BQYWvQggzfCmKjFORk8U
        * NOTE: even in healthy ppl, the small intestine doesnt totally digest FODMAPs. they are meant to go through and be fermented in colon - but healthy people have ecosystem that doesnt get hurt by the process
      * memo thoughts
        * [[2024-11-05]]
          * i need to memo FODMAPs
          * thought about how it's crazy inflammation happens in colon from fermentation byproducts, yet leads to inflammation/bloating that opens lower esophageal sphincter in stomach - which is somewhat far away from colon
        * [[2024-12-23]]
          * didnt memba bananas can have fructans woah...i thought just fructose


  * Symptoms
    * Abby said smoke smell in nose is often caused due to acid reflux based on her past patients. Something to do with burning of something inside body. Give them acid reflux stuff and it fixes it.
