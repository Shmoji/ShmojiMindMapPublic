  * Bones
    * Hyoid Bone
      * U-shaped
      * At the level of C3
      * Sits between mandible and thyroid cartilage
      * This is first bone just under jaw that has horns that poke out under jaw portion near ears during movement
      * Things it does
        * Helps to keep airway open in throat
      * This bone provides attachment point for:
        * strap muscles of neck
        * anterior part of oropharynx
        * inferior anchoring point for muscles of the tongue
  * Muscles
    * Suprahyoid muscles (group of 4)
      * They form the floor of the mouth. Go from mandible to hyoid bone.
      * Function:
        * Chewing, swallowing, speech
        * Responsible for positioning of hyoid bone
        * The digastric and stylohyoid muscles elevate the hyoid bone when swallowing and also pulling the hyoid bone backwards and keeping the mouth open
      * 1: Stylohyoid Muscle
        * Extends from Styloid process of temporal bone to the lesser horn of the hyoid bone. It is accompanied by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle.
      * 2: Digastric muscle
      * 3: Mylohyoid muscle
