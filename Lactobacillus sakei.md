  * what is it?
    * L. sakei is a probiotic used to make kimchi and has been shown to reduce sinus infections and may be useful to eradicate unhealthy bacteria such as MARCoNS by restoring a healthy nasal microbiome. You can either use kimchi juice (snort it into each nostril twice a day) or get the probiotic as a powder.

    * discord: multiple people said didn't help with sinus issues
