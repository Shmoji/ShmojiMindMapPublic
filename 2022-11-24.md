    * Took epsom salt/lavender bath again and got sweet taste in throat. I think that means it is just the lavender i am tasting. My jaw was still hurting after epsom salt bath today.
    * Noticed today my tongue is always white and that's not normal 
    * Had a lot of sweets bc Thanksgiving and felt absolutely horrible. Morning started with my jaw hurting near ear mostly. Ended day with entire jaw hurting, sinuses hurting, muscle weakness, and tooth pain/sensitivity
