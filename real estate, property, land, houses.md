    * [[2025-03-05]] my first real estate questions #[[fast memo]]
      * what is buying/buyers agent?
        * THEY WORK 4 U BOSS: licensed real estate professional who represents the person purchasing a property. Their main job is to help the buyer find a home that fits their needs and budget, guide them through the process, and advocate for their interests. This includes things like SEARCHING for listings, arranging SHOWINGS, negotiating the purchase price, and assisting with paperwork or financing details. They work to get the buyer the best deal possible and ensure the transaction goes smoothly.
        * other terms: buyer representative, broker, real estate agent
      * what is selling agent?
        * oh god it gets confusing
        * **Listing Agent**: This is the real estate agent hired by the seller to represent them directly. They’re responsible for listing the property on the market—think putting up the "For Sale" sign, posting it on MLS (Multiple Listing Service), taking photos, staging the home, and marketing it to attract buyers. They advise the seller on pricing, negotiate offers on their behalf, and guide them through the sale process to get the best price and terms. Their loyalty is 100% to the seller.
        * **Selling Agent**: This term is a bit trickier because it’s used in two ways, depending on context. Technically, the selling agent is the agent who "sells" the property by bringing the BUYER to the deal. In many cases, this is the buyer’s agent (the one I described earlier, working for the purchaser), who works with the listing agent to close the sale. However, in older real estate lingo or some regions, "selling agent" might casually refer to the listing agent—the one selling the property on behalf of the seller. For clarity: in standard practice now, just think of the selling agent as the buyer’s agent who makes the sale happen by connecting the buyer to the property.
          * tldr: just know difference in buyer's agent vs listing agent and ask which one they are
          * JAPAN SPECIFICALLY: In many cases, English-speaking contexts in Japan just use "seller’s agent" to mean the listing agent
        * other terms: "mediating agent" or "intermediary."
      * if i dont need them to travel, do you recommend i even do that?
        * Nope! bc that is extra money from my saifu
      * do leaseholds always have end date? what is leasehold vs freehold?
        * Yes. You own the property for set period, but DONT own the land at all
        * LEASEHOLDS: land owner basically has all control...which is risky
        * meme: THEY hold lease and rules. freehold: no hold - u are free to do whatever you want
        * GROUND RENT: often there is ground rent you gotta pay yearly. Sometimes it's monthly
        * **Service Charges**: If the leasehold is part of a building (like a condo or flat), you might pay extra for maintenance of shared areas—think elevators, hallways, or landscaping. These fees can pile up and sometimes spark disputes if they feel unfair or poorly managed.
        * **Subletting Rules**: Many leases control whether you can rent out the property to someone else. Some require freeholder permission, others ban it outright, especially in shorter-term leases.
        * tldr: there can be many rules they put on you...i may not be able to make the spot into whyspia third place...
        * it is different than renting bc you own prop
      * do i actually need akiyamart? maybe get advice of AkiyaCollective
      * still listed but under contract - what mean?
        * technically still active on the market (like on MLS or a listing site), but it’s already in the process of being sold because the seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. The phrase captures a transitional phase—it’s not fully sold yet, but it’s spoken for
        * meme: prop stuck under contract bc it GONE
      * when buying property, do you have to pay full price instantly? like property in japan? what about leasehold property?
        * no
        * DEPOSIT: first you agree on price. Then, you pay a deposit—commonly around 5-10% of the purchase price—to secure the deal.
        * CLOSING: The remaining balance is then paid at closing, which happens after due diligence (like title checks) and when the property is officially transferred to you. Closing might be a few weeks or months later, depending on the situation.
        * HOW MORTGAGE/LOANS WORK:
          * Buyers often use a mix of cash and loans, so if you’re getting a mortgage, the bank typically covers most of the balance at CLOSING, and you’d pay the bank back over time. Cash buyers, though, would need to have the full amount ready by that final step.
          * getting loan for prop in Japan could be tricky due to sellers rules
          * leasehold property is same as freehold for all dis, but getting loans may be trickier
          * cant you just get loan from your own country for the mortgage?
            * Most banks prefer to lend against properties in their own jurisdiction because it’s easier for them to assess the asset, enforce the loan if you default, and navigate local laws.
            * But you can - obv they dont know where your cash came from. BUT the rate MAY be much worse than local bank
            * NOTE: can also leverage equity of something like your car
          * MORTGAGE COST: seems typical mortgage could be around $1000/month - but for range im looking for - prob even cheaper
      * can i find buying agents without AMD?
        * yes, but more difficult. Definitely cheaper tho. Need to find english-speaking one (EDIT: wasnt too hard tbh)
