  * **What is Magnesium?**
    * One of the human body's primary **electrolyte minerals** involved in about **40% of all enzymes**.
  * **How does body use Magnesium?**
    * Magnesium is used in 3174 processes within the human body. This doesn't even account for the importance of Magnesium in **Mg-ATP development**, one of the main forms of **energy **in **EVERY **process of the body.
    * Excessive intracellular and extracellular Ca+2 (Calcium) is implicated in nearly every single **inflammator** cytokine and response within the body and guess what the body's primary defense **against hyper Ca+2 activation** is? **Magnesium**!
      * Ca+2/Calcium-glutamate hyperactivation **depletes magnesium** like no other while **displacing potassium** from the **mitochondria **and cells, creating a situation where the individual is susceptible to heart failure, among many other diseases/conditions.

  * **What depletes magnesium in the body?**
    * blue light (how much?), nnEMF, sunlight with poor redox status, agricultural toxins (pesticides, herbicides, fungicides), heavy metals, unbound copper and iron, molds, bacteria, viruses, parasites
  * **Notes that click**
    * With all of these factors involved with the modern environment today, Magnesium is rapidly drained on a daily basis and must be regained on a daily basis. Surplus intake is an excellent preventative approach against **mitochondrial dysfunction** as most everything popularized today contributes to hyper NMDA/Ca+2/**calcium activation** and **magnesium depletion**.
    * You ought to be on 2-6 different forms of Magnesium to fully support and saturate the body. Particularly **Magnesium Glycinate** and **Magnesium Chloride**.
  * **MY GOAL**
    * 575mg of ELEMENTAL Mag (recommended intake is 5-10mg ELEMENTAL per pound, so i took 5 * 115 = 575)
  * **My questions**
    * I've noticed most sources online say it's better to get all magnesium from natural sources and be careful with supplements. This is the kind of thing I would expect Grim to say , but he doesn't. I assume this is because the depletion of magnesium in the body is extremely high for most people nowadays due to things like: **blue light, nnEMF, sunlight with poor redox status, agricultural toxins (pesticides, herbicides, fungicides), heavy metals, unbound copper and iron, molds, bacteria, viruses, parasites**??
      * he basically says mag is mag - but you of course do want to be careful of harmful additives in supps
    * by how much or how quick does each one of the above list deplete magnesium by? is it really that much and how can we know? (im mainly interested in ones that affect me, so blue light and nnEMF).
  * **Risks of Taking Magnesium Supplements**
    * Severe neuroinflammation-type people (Lyme, mold, etc) seem to have severe **negative reactions** to **glycine **(most of Meg Glycinate). Grim said: Both magnesium glycinate and l-theanine in isolation, latter with its partial NMDA agonism, have the potential for excitation dependent on GABA/glutamate imbalance. This is why I recommend the magnesium glycinate and l-theanine always in combination to force inhibitory activity. Some people are extremely imbalanced and must work to shift that balance back with B1/B2/B3/B6 and magnesium repletion. While restoring balance between zinc and copper/iron. Putting Mag Glycinate in Kefir can help this issue. Sensitive people still require glycine intake so the magnesium glycinate, potentially even paired with another inhibitory form of magnesium, such as chloride, taurate, or malate (latter goes into oxaloacetate - glutamate scavenger), should increase tolerance to excitation.
  * **Reasons behind magnesium intolerant symptoms**:
    * Thiamine deficiency
    * Sodium/potassium deficiency
    * Low redox/lack of natural light, especially red/IR
    * Leaky gut (aldosterone axis dysfunction)
    * Cellular dehydration (nnEMF toxicity)
    * some are sensitive to the glycine component into Mg glycinate due to **GABA/glutamate imbalance**. Another form like chloride or malate would be more suitable if this is the case
    * Remember, Mg is a **hydrophilic cation** so if it’s **not dissolved** in **spring/RO water** or you’re exposing yourself to **fluoride **or too much **artificial blue light/nnEMF**, you are **dehydrated on a cellular level** and will be **unable to absorb** it properly
  * **What to do if having bowel flushes**:
    * 1) Resolve these issues
    * 2) Spread the magnesium out throughout the day in smaller amounts
    * 3) Consume with soluble fiber and protein rich meal
    * 4) Topical magnesium chloride to build the body’s stores without flush
  * **How Much Mag to take?**
    * **STARTING OUT**:
    * If you are **just starting** Magnesium supplementation, you will want to start slow and low with about 400mg Mg glycinate orally or 1/4-1/2 tsp Mg chloride in drinking water and see how you respond. If you do not experience a bowel flush, you may gradually increase dosage as you feel comfortable until you hit that goal intake per lb of body weight.
    * If you **immediately have **a **bowel flush**, it is likely you are **deficient **in **thiamine (vitamin B1)**, **sodium**, and/or **potassium**, in which case topical application and having any oral Magnesium with fiber intake would be recommended.
    * you will want to find your, what is known as a **bowel flush level**, and maintain just below it.
    * Optimal intake as portrayed by Mildred Seelig, Ph.D. and Carolyn Dean, MD is about **5-10mg ELEMENTAL Magnesium** per **pound **of **body weight**. For reference, the two primary forms I recommend are 14% elemental Mg by weight for **Magnesium glycinate,** but this can be rounded down to **10%**, and **25%** elemental Mg per weight for **Magnesium chloride**. So as an example, someone who is 100lbs would consume 5000mg of Magnesium glycinate throughout the day. However, it is best to consume **multiple forms** with multiple routes of administration for the best saturation of the entire body. With healthy kidneys, you really can’t get “too much magnesium”.  Oral **over-dose** just **flushes the intestines**.  And the body uses it up fast every day in every process that requires ATP or energy.
    * Ex from Grim below in "**When to take Mag?**"
  * **When to take Mag?**
    * MAIN high dose should be reserved for before sleep as this is when almost every cleanse detox and repair process occurs. Your daytime doses can be about 1/10th of your nighttime dose, maybe 3-5 times throughout the day, but also important to have especially each time there is FOOD involved.
    * Ex from Grim: I am around 150 lb give or take, and I consume around 10-15g of Magnesium in multiple forms on a daily basis. To put this into perspective, I have 400mg Magnesium glycinate with 200mg L-theanine **upon waking**, another 400/200mg **after breakfast**, and 1000/1000mg about **30-60 min. before sleep**. Then I also have around 1/2 tsp (2.5g) Magnesium chloride **per liter of water** that I drink, and I have around **4-6 liters per day**. I apply the topical Magnesium chloride spray **before my first walk in the morning** to catch the sunrise, which enables proper **vitamin D synthesis**, and again before and after I lift weights in the evening.
  * **Mag Glycinate**
    * Magnesium glycinate is magnesium + glycine. Only 12% of it is magnesium, 88% being glycine
    * Can give intense dreams and ruin sleep for some
    * Chloride or glycinate are both fine, both** regulate endothelial function**, **mitigate inflammation**, and **regulate calcium** storage - MAG does this, not the chloride/glycinate
