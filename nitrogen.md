    * Joe Rogan and Elon: most nitrogen for fertilizer is sucked out of air
      * elon: one of biggest innovations in chemistry was binding nitrogen. Pretty hard to bind nitrogen out of air into ammonia.
      * elon: binding nitrogen out of air was crucial for fertilizing food. Life saving invention at scale bc you run out of nitrogen. Was fundamental issue for most of civilization - how to get nitrogen for plants. Pure nitrogen is lower energy state, so to bind into fertilize takes a lot of energy. 
      * Joe read: 50% of nitrogen in our bodies comes from this innovation from fertilizer in food we eat.
