    * [[pixel streaming|PIXEL STREAMING]]: basically make any unreal or unity app accessible through web on any device - even crappy hardware devices. But very expensive to self host or use provider. BUT you wont have to go through any app store. Just have to deal with centralization of provider OR deal with hosting your own and complexity of that
