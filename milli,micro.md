  * tracking learning milli vs micro
    * [[2024-09-30]] ms vs us, mm vs um, real world examples, nm, pm, planck length #[[fast memo]]
      * A **millisecond** (ms) is one-thousandth of a second (1 ms = 0.001 seconds or 10^-3 seconds).
        * **Milliseconds (ms):** Used to measure relatively small time intervals, like the **refresh rate** of a screen or the **latency** in network communication. or ping or **response rate** or **action potential length**
      * A **microsecond** (µs) is one-millionth of a second (1 µs = 0.000001 seconds or 10^-6 seconds)
        * **Microseconds (µs):** Used for even smaller time intervals, such as measuring the response time of electronic components or processes in real-time systems (TODO: wish i could find better example)
      * For context:
        * 1 second = 1000 milliseconds
        * 1 millisecond = 1000 microseconds
      * confused me bc milli makes you think that one is one-millionth
      * A **millimeter** (mm) is one-thousandth of a meter (1 mm = 0.001 meters or 10^-3 meters).
        * **Millimeters (mm):** Used to measure small lengths like the thickness of a coin or the size of small objects like pea/peanut/fruit. 1mm is about size of **pencil tip** - 5mm is about size of **pencil eraser** on pencil
        * close in size but good bit smaller than cm (1 order of magnitude smaller, 2 oom to dm)
        * in ammo, the mm number is describing the "caliber" which is almost always the DIAMETER of the ammo (and maybe more). From what im seeing, it seems **first number** is often diameter and next is **length**. Q: why do they sometimes start with a decimal point. A: .45 caliber means the bullet is 0.45 inches in diameter. i guess it will say mm when using mm....but maybe not...i guess it's obvious bc mm is so much smaller than an inch - one is decimal and one is not (well actually 7.62 is mm lol)
      * A **micrometer** (µm) is one-millionth of a meter (1 µm = 0.000001 meters or 10^-6 meters).
        * **Micrometers (µm):** Used for very tiny measurements, such as the **diameter of cells** or the thickness of thin materials. or **average human hair**/distance of electrode to neuron (100um)
      * A nanometer nm is one billionth of a meter. Nanoplastics reeee (1 x 10^-9m)
        * diameter of an atom is approximately 1 × 10^-10 meters. their diameters typically ranging from about 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers. It's important to note that atomic sizes can vary slightly depending on the element and its environment. However, the order of magnitude (10^-10 m) remains consistent for most atoms.
        * The nucleus of an atom, which contains the protons and neutrons, is even smaller - approximately 10^-15 meters in diameter. This means the nucleus is about 100,000 times smaller than the entire atom - skipped pico and went to femto
      * A picometer pm is next smaller - one trillionth of a meter (1 x 10^-12m)
      * Femtometer is next...but sheesh - one quadrillionth of a meter (1 x 10^-15m) - can remember F bc pico took pm
      * the planck length is 1.616255×10−35 meters holy crap - smallest possible length in our universe

          * seems these love to iterate in 3 orders of magnitude. just like 3 0s is when you get new commas in base10: 1,000,000
