      * had meeting with Victor and River today on cocreating.
      * River mentioned some way to cocreate that makes "less individual responsibility" - which resonated. imo this often takes the form of just QandA - hey how is your team making sure users own their data?
      * memetic symbol for bringing people together. Similar to web3, crypto, etc. Symbol that wraps "new forms of connecting and communicating". names for this from Victor:
        * sociotech
        * cocreation, creator journey
      * other Victor notes
        * how to facilitate the cocreative journey
        * Victor mentioned programs to facilitate cocreation - i liked that bc made me think of university classes which did indeed get me to make progress on something - could have classes for this project
      * same MISSION
        * just realized Victor is same mission but social instead of building app
        * i feel im trying to group people with this same MISSION AND are actively BUILDING a more precise mindmapping, new communication form - thing
      * some other notes i had for this meeting
        * things to do or bring up relative to main topic
          * how to bring together everyone that is creating the same general thing, but being engineered differently - mind mapping, connection, enhancing humanity instead of leaving us to meaninglessness in age of automation
          * i worry doing meeting like this would end up like standup meeting - with no value. I know a somewhat consistent connecting could be valuable, i just dont know how to actually do it. I'd even love just to create a X community for this, but then how do you name it? Would that even be useful, etc. Any advice?
          * how would i benefit from getting these builders together?
            * to see how they handle this: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/hugz project, emote, symbol fun#^X8DBgnlkl|how can we do decentralized storage where users own their data? is it worth it]]
            * to help each other optimize UX
            * to figure out how to collaborate as we build the underlying systems
      * another thought: James loves talking, so feel there's defs some way to help him here
