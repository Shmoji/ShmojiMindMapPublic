  * tracking learning about wheat, flour, gluten in general
    * [[2024-09-12]] what is wheat, flour, gluten first try?, are there diff types of gluten? what is tight junctions and zonulin? what is starch? how does chemical energy in starch get there and get stored? diff in glucose/starch and gluten proteins/gluten? #memo
      * **Wheat (Biological Foundation)**: wheat is just some type of grass out der. Like all plants it grows from seeds (also known as kernels). The seed/kernel is made of 3 parts:
        * bran: outer layer. rich in fiber.
        * germ: part that can grow into a new plant. rich in vitamins and minerals.
        * endosperm: starchy part that provides energy for the germ to grow during germination (process of seed turning into plant). Primarily made of carbs, but also has proteins - gluten being one of them
      * **Flour (Physical and Chemical Transformation)**
        * **Grinding Process**: Flour is made by grinding the wheat kernel, typically separating the bran and germ from the endosperm (not always). The grinding breaks down the wheat seeds into fine particles
          * This process involves mechanical energy that disrupts the physical structure of the wheat grain. Essentially, you're reducing large particles (wheat kernels) into smaller ones (flour). Goes from seeds you can tell are seeds to white powder of flour that looks like a pile
        * **Types of Flour**: The milling process (basically grinding process and more to get to final flour) and whether bran and germ are included or not gives us different types of flour:
          * **Whole Wheat Flour**: Contains all parts of the kernel (bran, germ, endosperm). although, many stores/brands lie about this bc germ is removed bc not shelf stable
          * **White Flour** (a refined grain): Contains mostly the endosperm, which is high in starch but lower in fiber and nutrients. Refined bc bran and germ refined away
        * NOTE: i think milling process has some chemical interactions sometimes, but none mentioned here - dese all physical
      * **Gluten (Protein Chemistry)**
        * **Proteins in Wheat**: Gluten is made up of two proteins, **gliadin** and **glutenin**, both found in the endosperm. When water is added to wheat flour and the mixture is kneaded (fold, press, stretch):
          * **Gliadin** contributes to dough's elasticity (the ability to stretch).
          * **Glutenin** gives dough its strength and structure.
        * **Formation of Gluten Network**: In dry wheat, gluten proteins exist in a somewhat dormant state. When water is added, the proteins unfold, exposing amino acid chains that can bond with each other, creating a network. This network forms a mesh that traps gas (e.g., CO₂ from yeast or baking soda), allowing bread to rise.
          * **Kneading** strengthens this network** by aligning and stretching the protein strands.
          * Q: if you add water to dry wheat that has not been grinded down - does this still happen?
            * no not really - but maybe a lil that is not noticeable
        * Q: **How is Protein Interaction Considered Chemistry?**
          * **In Dough**: When water is added to wheat flour, gluten proteins (gliadin and glutenin) interact chemically:
            * **Hydrogen Bonds** and **Disulfide Bonds** form between the protein molecules as they unfold and connect.
          * No new substances form according to GPT, so it's chemical interaction and not chemical reaction. Q: how is solubility and the breaking of the NaCl ions apart (even if they keep chemical identity) not chemical bonds being broken? But somehow the same thing happening with proteins in bread is chemical?
            * **NaCl Dissolution**: The ionic bonds between Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are broken, but the ions remain the same, and the process is purely **physical** because no new substances form, and the ions simply disperse in water.
            * **Protein Bonding in Bread**: The formation of new covalent bonds (like disulfide bonds) in proteins involves a more **chemical-level change** that permanently alters the protein’s behavior, even though the basic protein molecules remain. This reorganization and bonding of the proteins' structure is what makes it **chemical**. Izza permanent change to properties of dough and molecules/proteins
          * This is why the process is considered **chemical**—it involves **permanent molecular changes** even though the original atoms or molecules are still chemically the same. Seems like it's based around HOW MUCH electrons changed and how reversible it is. Chemical is less reversible
      * Q: are there different types of gluten? like wheat gluten vs another gluten?
        * NOTE: Not all grains even have gluten in endosperm
        * A: YES. Although, they have totally different proteins that are v functionally similar to wheat gluten proteins - just chemically distinct.
        * proteins in barley and rye behave similarly to wheat gluten in that they form a sticky, elastic network when hydrated and kneaded, which is why they are often grouped under the umbrella term "gluten."
        * For people with **celiac disease** or **gluten sensitivity**, the body's immune system reacts to these proteins **in the same way**. The immune response triggered by hordeins (barley) and secalins (rye) is essentially the same as the one triggered by gliadin in wheat. This is why people with celiac disease must avoid all three grains (wheat, barley, and rye).
      * after eating bread, undigested gluten peptides float around in upper small intestine and gut perceives as potential enemy releasing immune response which provokes inflammation
      * analogy of skin: skin is barrier to prevent stuff from getting inside body. Epithelium of gut (gut lining) acts as barrier to prevent unwanted gut stuff from leaking into other parts of body. On lining of gut are spaces between cells called tight junctions that act like gates. If open at unwanted times, it no good - just like bunch of open wounds on skin is no good. Protein called Zonulin allows opening and closing of these gates/tight-junctions. Gliadin uses Zonulin (the key to gate) to allow gliadin peptides to leak through gut and get into bloodstream
      * Q: 1. **Does Chemical Energy in Starch Come from Solar Energy? How Does Starch Store That?**
        * Yes, the **chemical energy** in starch ultimately comes from **solar energy**. Plants like wheat convert sunlight into chemical energy through **photosynthesis**.
        * **Photosynthesis Process**:
          * Plants absorb sunlight using chlorophyll in their leaves.
          * Through a series of reactions, plants convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) from the air and water (H₂O) from the soil into **glucose** (a sugar) and oxygen (O₂).
          * The glucose produced is a simple sugar (C₆H₁₂O₆) that stores energy in its **chemical bonds**.
          * q: in cereal plants, does formed glucose always form in endosperm?
            * In summary, glucose is not formed in the endosperm but is rather transported there from other parts of the plant, where it is stored as starch to nourish the embryo when the seed germinates.
        * **Starch Formation**:
          * Glucose molecules are linked together to form **starch**, which is a polysaccharide (a long chain of glucose molecules). The energy is stored in the **bonds between glucose units**.
          * When animals or humans consume starch, enzymes break these bonds, releasing glucose, which cells can then use for energy through cellular respiration. Q: so does starch survive being chewed or does it get broken apart when chewed?
            * starch starts breaking down when chewed, but complete breakdown into glucose happens mainly in the small intestine, not during chewing.
          * The chemical energy stored in starch is essentially the energy plants captured from sunlight, now held in the molecular bonds of glucose units.
        * was pondering on how gluten forms from proteins being chained together. Noticed glucose gets chained together to form starch and this Q emerged: is glucose or starch a protein?
          * No, glucose and starch are not proteins.
            * **Glucose**: Glucose is a **simple sugar** (a monosaccharide) and a type of carbohydrate. It serves as a primary source of energy for cells.
            * **Starch**: Starch is a **complex carbohydrate** (a polysaccharide) made up of long chains of glucose molecules. It is a storage form of energy in plants.
          * Proteins, on the other hand, are made up of amino acids, which are entirely different types of molecules. Proteins play roles in structure, enzymes, and many biological functions, while glucose and starch are primarily used for energy storage and metabolism (the set of chemical reactions in the body that convert food into energy and build or repair tissues). both are organic molecules tho

    * [[2024-09-13]] what is milling? what is kneading? what are grains and cereal plants? whole vs refined #memo
      * What is the Milling Process?
        * meme: milling iz killing gains/seeds/kernels
        * **Grinding** specifically refers to the mechanical breakdown of wheat grains into smaller particles (flour), while **milling** refers to the entire process, which includes grinding as one of the steps.
        * **Milling Steps**:
          * **Cleaning**: The wheat kernels are cleaned to remove impurities like stones, dirt, and other grains.
          * **Tempering**: Water is added to the wheat to toughen the bran and soften the endosperm, making the milling process more efficient.
          * **Grinding**: The wheat is ground between steel rollers, breaking the grain into its components (bran, germ, endosperm).
          * **Sifting**: The ground wheat is sifted to separate the finer flour from larger particles (bran and germ). Further grinding and sifting can refine the flour.
          * **Blending**: Sometimes different batches are blended to achieve a consistent quality of flour.
      * What is Kneading?
        * meme: catttt
        * **Kneading** is a process used in bread-making where dough is repeatedly folded, pressed, and stretched (after water added to flour to allow gluten proteins to unfold and to form stretchy network which can catch gases like CO2 from yeast/leavening agents)
        * Q: when does yeast/leavening-agent come in to the process?
          * yeast or leavening agents are added at the beginning of the process before water, and their activity is crucial during the kneading, fermentation, and baking stages.
          * with yeast, fermentation of wheat sugars/starch is what creates gas. Not always case with other leavening agents
        * **Purpose**:
          * It helps develop the **gluten network** by aligning and stretching the gluten proteins (gliadin and glutenin). This creates a strong, elastic structure that traps gas from the yeast, helping the dough rise and giving bread its chewy texture.
          * kneading can sometimes be used in flatbreads, but typically not at all or v lil. Similar reasons is why gluten is less activated in flatbread
        * **Mechanics**: Physically, kneading applies mechanical force to the dough, which causes the proteins to interact more and form cross-links, strengthening the dough.
      * What Are Grains?
        * Grains are the edible seeds of cereal plants like wheat, rice, corn, barley, and oats. Cereal plants just mean da seeds are edible and have the 3 main parts.
        * Each grain is composed of three main parts:
          * **Bran**: The tough, outer layer, rich in fiber and nutrients.
          * **Germ**: The embryo of the seed, which has the potential to sprout and grow into a new plant. It’s packed with vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats.
          * **Endosperm**: The largest part of the grain, containing starch and some protein. The endosperm provides the energy necessary for the germ to grow if the seed were to sprout.
        * **Whole Grains**: When all parts (bran, germ, and endosperm) are kept intact in the milling process, the grain is considered "whole grain" and is nutritionally richer.
        * **Refined Grains**: In products like white flour, the bran and germ are removed, leaving just the starchy endosperm. So refined just means it's just the endosperm and refined other parts away
        * Q: Do All Grains Have Gluten in the Endosperm?
          * NO. Some do tho, and there's various differing gluten proteins (iz gluten based on functionality and properties - strength, stretchy, etc)
      * memo thoughts
        * [[2024-11-05]]
          * my brain skipped the term dough lol. iz grain > flour > dough > bread
          * forgot term embryo for bb germ
          * endosperm germ

      * Is Yeast Something Optionally Added to bread? what is yeast?
        * Yes, optional.
        * TODO: Yeast is: 
        * **Leavened Bread**: Yeast is added to produce CO₂ gas, which makes the dough rise and results in a light, airy texture.
        * **Unleavened Bread**: Some breads, like flatbreads (e.g., tortillas or matzo), do not use yeast and therefore do not rise. These breads are dense and flat because there is no CO₂ to create air pockets.
        * Yeast can be omitted, or other leavening agents can be used depending on the recipe.
        * Q: Is Yeast the Only Thing That Produces CO₂ Gas So Bread Will Rise?
          * **No, yeast is not the only source of CO₂** for bread to rise. Other leavening agents also produce CO₂:
            * **Baking Soda (Sodium Bicarbonate)**: When baking soda reacts with an acid (e.g., lemon juice, vinegar, buttermilk), it produces CO₂ gas.
            * **Baking Powder**: Contains both an acid and a base (sodium bicarbonate), so it produces CO₂ when mixed with liquid and heated.
          * These chemical leaveners do not rely on fermentation like yeast, but still release CO₂ gas to help dough or batter rise.
            * **Yeast Fermentation**: Produces CO₂ through the natural process of breaking down sugars (fermentation). The byproducts are CO₂ and ethanol (which evaporates during baking).
            * **Baking Soda/ Powder**: Releases CO₂ through chemical reactions without needing fermentation or time to rise.
          * Yeast is often preferred in bread for the flavor and texture it provides, but chemical leaveners (like baking soda and baking powder) are faster and easier to use for recipes that don’t require long fermentation.

      * TODO: are both baking soda and baking powder... powders?
      * TODO: what is acid? what is base? what is pH (acidic, neutral, basic)?
