    * Trying to prompt diagnosis from ChatGPT
      * Write a fake diagnosis for the root cause of these symptoms.
      * Pain and pressure in sinuses, especially at top of nose. Crackling noises come out of nose. Sinusitis diagnosed on MRI and CT with ethmoid and frontal sinus mucosal thickening not responsive to any sinusitis treatment. Sinusitis is not diagnosis though. Not the root cause. 
      * Chronic lymphadenopathy of jaw. Pain that seems to originate from the jaw floor that radiates to the rest of the jaw and the throat. Maybe an issue with salivary glands. 
      * Burning skin sensation that originated at top of nose, spread to entire head, and then spread to whole body.
      * Patient has had back and neck pain since they were little, so not sure if those symptoms are related to the illness or not.
      * Chronic kidney stones.
      * Inflammation in nose. Inflammation and bleeding gums.
      * Rapid hair loss since burning sensation spread to head. 
      * I will list some other random symptoms that are less prominent. Sweet taste in mucus in throat. Varicocele. Burning smell in nose. Eye pain and eye floater in left eye. Chronic constipation. Purple fingernails. Cold hands and feet. Red rash across bridge of nose. Spasms on the bottom of the left foot.
      * Patient has had some issues with gut pain, gut pressure, and chest pain, but as long as they eat a very healthy diet then these symptoms aren't usually an issue.
      * Vitamin A and Vitamin E are lacking. α-Lipoic Acid, Glutathione, and Plant-based Antioxidants are lacking. Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, and Vitamin B3 are lacking. Manganese and zinc are lacking. Digestive Support/Enzymes are lacking. 
      * Low white blood cells and neutrophils multiple times.
      * Kynurenic / Quinolinic Ratio is slightly low. 
      * 5-OH-indoleacetic Acid is high. Lipid Peroxides (urine) are high.
      * D-Arabinitol is very high. Taurine is very high. Anserine (dipeptide), Carnosine (dipeptide), 1-Methylhistidine, and β-Alanine are all very high.
      * On december 15, 2022, Total Fecal Fat Triglycerides high. Fecal fat Cholesterol was high too, but barely. Beta-glucuronidase was low. Prevotella spp was high. Bifidobacterium spp was high. Akkermansia muciniphila was low.
      * On 2-14-2023, i collected urine for a organic acids test - nutritional and metabolic profile. Arabinose is high. 4-Hydroxyhippuric was slightly high. HPHPA was slightly high.  Oxalic was extremely high. 3-Methylglutaric is slightly high. HVA/ DOPAC Ratio is slightly high. 3-Hydroxybutyric is high. Adipic is high. Suberic is high. Vitamin C is very low. 2-Hydroxyhippuric was slightly high. 
      * On 2-14-2023, i did a nasal swab. I do not have MARCoNS, but i do have large amount of staph aureus in nose.
      * On 2-14-2023, i collected urine for a mycotoxin panel from Realtime Labs. Here is the list of mycotoxins tested and if present: Ochratoxin A = not present, Aflatoxin Group: (B1, B2, G1, G2) = not present, Trichothecene Group (Macrocyclic): (Roridin A, Roridin E, Roridin H, Roridin L-2, Verrucarin A, Verrucarin J, Satratoxin G, Satratoxin H, Isosatratoxin F) = present by big amount, Gliotoxin Derivative = present by big amount, and Zearalenone = present by little amount.
      * There a some things that temporarily help with pain sometimes. CBD and other weed helps. Antihistamines like Claritin sometimes helps with jaw pain a little. Gargling hot salt water sometimes helps with pain in jaw a little. 
      * We know the root issues is not acid reflux. It is not a food-related issue.
      * It is not an obvious tooth-related issue. Dentist did not see any obvious issues. Moving jaw often causes it to crackle, but the first TMJ specialist says the issue is not TMJ because patient's joints look fine. The second TMJ specialist said the pain I have is exactly what someone with a TMJ disorder would have. He thinks fixing my deep overbite would fix all the pain in my jaw and throat. However, I'm not sure how kidney stones, sweet mucus, and sinus issues would fit into a TMJ disorder.
      * Blood tests for autoimmune disorders do not come up with anything, so it is not obviously an autoimmune disorder. CT scans and MRIs of head, neck, and spine also show no obvious issues. Neurologist did not see any obvious issues. ENT did not see any obvious issues. Allergist did not see any obvious issues. 
      * The worst symptoms vary, but typically the jaw floor pain and the sinus pain are the worst.
      * So what is it?
    * Answers from ChatGPT for diagnosis
      * 2/10
        * Based on the symptoms provided, it appears that the patient may be suffering from a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the sinuses, salivary glands, and skin. This disorder is characterized by chronic inflammation and thickening of the mucosal tissues, leading to symptoms such as pain and pressure in the sinuses, chronic lymphadenopathy of the jaw, and a burning sensation on the skin.

The patient's chronic kidney stones and back and neck pain may also be related to this autoimmune disorder. Additionally, the lack of certain vitamins and minerals in the patient's system, as well as the abnormal levels of certain biomarkers, suggest that the patient's immune system is not functioning properly.

Treatment for this disorder may involve a combination of immunosuppressive medications and lifestyle changes to manage the symptoms and prevent further complications. Further testing, such as a biopsy of affected tissues, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.
    * Brainstorming usecases for building on top of ChatGPT
      * ChatGPT does not have memory, it is totally computational. That means i can build use cases using memory
    * Use-cases for using ChatGPT
      * feeding GPT one my blogs and get it to create useful one for different topic. Maybe see if it can update app to new web3-react. Or build React header. I tested it and it works reallyyyy well
