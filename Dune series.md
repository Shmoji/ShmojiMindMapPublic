    * tracking my thoughts
      * [[2024-03-09]]
        * 6-7/10
        * religion, politics, power, control, release, love, faith
        * im assuming the Bene Gesserits wanted Paul dead because they realized he was too powerful and they would lose control
        * so are the Great Houses more powerful than the Emperor and the Bene Gesserits?
        * nuts that you find out that Jessica is daughter or Baron fat guy of Harkonnen
        * i wonder if Paul really saw the only good future. I wonder if hes actually secretly being controlled. I wonder if taking more control was actually bad for him.
        * i was confused why Bene Gesserits wanted daughter of jessica to have male kid with Fade - but i guess it has to due with getting right gene activated. But also confused why they were so sure they could control that male if it was a Kwisatz Haderach
        * things that dont make sense
          * apparently they act like Jessica chose to have a son. Or somehow her love led to a son. Doesnt make any sense
          * so a female Bene Gesserit can only see all past, but male can see past and future - or am i wrong?
    * characters
      * Irulan
        * daughter of emperor Paul usurps
      * Chani
        * Paul's gf
        * Fremen girl
      * Kwisatz Haderach
        * The Bene Gesserit have been genetically crossbreeding for thousands of years to create someone with these powers. Except they had planned Jessica would be the KH's grandmother, not the mother. Jessica was supposed to have a daughter who would be married to Feyd Harkonnen and their son would then be KH. By having a son, Jessica upset all the BG's plans and the KH escaped their control.
      * Lisan al-gaib
        * false prophecy created by the BG among indigenous peoples to prepare them to blindly follow the KH when he'll be borned
