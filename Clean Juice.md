  * Smoothies
    * Pumpkin One
      * 4/10
      * im uncertain if it was worth it - even for the holiday vibes
      * tasted like water with a bit of a pumpkin spice flavor
    * Heart Healthy One
      * The flavor of this was not good. It was like milk and watermelon flavor. 
      * Tried this on [[2022-09-19]]
  * Bowls
    * Peanut butter one
      * taste wise: 10/10
      * in terms of fullness: 5/10
      * is price worth it? not really, it's expensive - all bowls are
