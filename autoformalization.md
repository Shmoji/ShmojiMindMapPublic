  * what is it?
    * well googling gives confusing definitions. You get stuff like: "Autoformalization is the process of automatically translating from natural language mathematics to formal specifications and proofs"
      * me: but that doesnt seem like the same definition you gave me - how can i understand this statement in the same way you defined it?
        * GPT3.5: So, in simpler terms, autoformalization in this context means making math more understandable to computers by translating it into a language they can process and reason with.
    * GPT gave a beautiful and very understandable answer: Autoformalization, in simple terms, is the concept of a system or process becoming self-aware and capable of defining its own rules or logic. It's like a computer program that can not only execute commands but also modify and define its own programming rules as it learns and evolves.
