        * email to Carman of cLab at SFU
        * the prompt from Carman:
          * a description of research interests related to the lab’s existing research; you need to show clear evidence that you have *actually *looked at the types of research the lab does
          * a curriculum vitae
          * a copy of your unofficial transcript
          * a picture of you showcasing your chosen superhero powers
          * Why do I want to see the superhero photo?  I want to see your creativity.  I want to see your personality.  I want to see your programming, design, or media skills.
        * my response:
          * Hello, potential future graduate student here. The site said to send email between September and January, so hopefully this is the correct time.
          * I did a good bit of research into various labs across the world that resonated with my passions and cLab resonated the most.
          * For the last few years my passion has been technology to connect people across space and time. Anything that fits that generally aligns with me; however, I've focused on specific aspects of these technologies for my own projects:
          * - A simple way to let people know you're thinking about them.
          * - The project everyone seems to resonate with: an event-based notification system that fosters spontaneous yet intentional social interactions. Users can define events, such as "I'm going fishing," and others can subscribe to be notified only when that specific event is emitted by that specific person.
          * - I started working on an idea for co-presence, but halted that one. It was focused on parallel play across distance. When you want to spend time with people, but with varying levels of interaction with those people (maybe no interaction except a little icon showing they are there with you).
          * I absolutely love every project I have seen from cLab - especially those related to co-presence. Having heated seats indicate the direction of another far-away person is so cool!
          * I created a web simulation for my superhero power and screenshotted it. Only reason this superpower is needed is because no one has ever built the technology. My superhero power is: I can create a force field that whenever anyone inside of it wants to talk about something or express something niche inside, they can optionally send that signal to the force field - which then will match that person with someone aligned for whatever the content is they want to talk about. If you want to talk about electromagnetism, then it's probably good to get paired up with someone also knowledgeable about that topic.

        * Fulbright Program with me intending to do independent research in Uni of Auckland NZ
            * Project Title
          * Technology to truly connect people across space and time
            * Abstract/Summary of Proposal: Prepare an executive summary detailing the what, where, and why of your proposed project․ If you are proposing the pursuit of a graduate degree program, summarize the program and its relevance to your career/education plans․
          * I am proposing independent research in Canada focused on creating digital tools that enhance meaningful connections between people across space and time. My project involves designing an event-based notification system that fosters spontaneous yet intentional social interactions. Users can define events, such as "I'm going fishing," and others can subscribe to be notified only when that specific event occurs. For example, a user named James could notify his friend, who only very occasionally joins him for fishing, without overwhelming them with unnecessary invites and social pressures. This system enables users to maintain connections based on shared interests and availability, bridging gaps caused by busy schedules or changing priorities.
          * In addition, I will explore ways to preserve the sense of presence people experience during in-person interactions, even across long distances. By investigating how technology can support long-term relationships and community building, this research contributes to human-computer interaction (HCI) and social sciences.
          * You can start to see how proposed technologies can further connect you with those you care about or introduce ways to connect with new people. I want to research this in Canada because of affiliate connections to medical care facilities and the various human-computer interaction (HCI) research labs, providing an ideal setting for testing these tools in both social and healthcare contexts.
            * Host Country Engagement: A key purpose of the Fulbright program is to be a cultural ambassador while living abroad. How will you engage outside of the workplace to fulfill this mission? In what ways do you plan to share your culture and values in your host community? Provide specific ideas.
                * I aim to fully immerse myself in Canada’s culture and build meaningful connections across a broad spectrum of society—from academics and professionals to medical patients and people I meet in everyday life. I believe that genuine human connection begins with curiosity and kindness, which are core aspects of my personal values.
                * Curiosity is a fundamental part of my culture. I approach the world with an open mind, always eager to learn about different perspectives and experiences. At the same time, the Golden Rule—treating others as I wish to be treated—guides my interactions, ensuring that I engage with people in a respectful and compassionate way. This mindset will shape how I approach Canada’s culture, encouraging me to listen and learn as much as I share.
                * I plan to exchange ideas with my host community in a way that is empathetic and non-intrusive, always considering the cultural context. I love discussing a wide range of topics, from emerging technology to spirituality, daily routines, and life’s simple pleasures. These conversations will offer me the chance to share my own knowledge and experiences while learning how these subjects are viewed and practiced in Canada. By fostering meaningful dialogue, I hope to bridge cultural gaps and create a deeper mutual understanding.
                * Through these actions, I aim to not only represent my own culture but also to become an active, engaged participant in my host community, fulfilling the Fulbright mission of promoting cultural exchange and mutual respect.
            * Describe your career and/or educational plans after completing a Fulbright grant
          * After completing the Fulbright grant, my goal is to continue advancing my research on technologies that enhance human connection across space and time. I have a range of subprojects that I am eager to pursue, particularly focused on preserving the sense of presence people experience during in-person interactions, even when they are separated by distance. I am committed to working on solutions that can be implemented in the near term while also exploring new and emerging technologies to tackle this challenge.
          * If I am unable to directly continue my research, I plan to further my education in a field closely aligned with my work, while continuing my research independently as I have always done. My passion for this subject will guide the next steps in my career, whether through academic pursuits or hands-on innovation.
            * Statement of Grant Purpose
            * prompt at first
            * now im doing the statement of grant purpose. Here is instructions: "This 2-page document outlines the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How of what you are proposing for your Fulbright grant. If you are pursuing a research project, developing a strong, feasible and compelling project is the most important aspect of a successful Fulbright application.
            * The first step is to thoroughly read the award description for your selected award and host country to understand the type of grant you are allowed to propose (Independent Study/Research or Graduate Degree Enrollment). Depending on the country and award parameters, applicants may have the option to propose completing a graduate degree program. Some countries have specific arrangements or named awards for graduate study. In this case, applicants should focus on demonstrating the reasons for pursuing the proposed graduate program at a particular institution in the host country.
            * Whether you are applying for a research project or a degree program, the proposal should indicate a clear commitment to the host country community and a description of how you will engage with it.
            * Develop an intellectually compelling and feasible project: This is the most important factor in presenting a successful application. Program design will vary by country and award, and while some countries encourage applicants to incorporate coursework into a project, others prefer independent research. You should ensure that your proposed project fits the program guidelines for the host country and award.
            * For applicants proposing independent study/research projects, address the following points:
            * With whom do you propose to work?
            * What do you propose to do?
            * What is innovative about the research? What will this research contribute to the field/discipline?
            * What are the specific research goals and methodologies?
            * What is important or significant about the project?
            * What contribution will the project make toward the Fulbright goal of promoting cultural exchange and mutual understanding?
            * When will you carry out the project? Include a feasible timeline.
            * Where do you propose to conduct your study or research? Why did you choose this location?
            * Why do you want to undertake this project?
            * What are your qualifications for carrying out this project?
            * Why does the project have to be conducted in the country of application?
            * How will your project help further your academic or professional development?
            * How will you engage with the host country community? Give specific ideas that relate to your own personal or professional interests.
            * Design a feasible project: You must demonstrate that your research strategy is viable, including its content, methodology, and time frame.
            * Address the following points:
            * How will the culture and politics of the host country impact the work?
            * Will the resources of the host country support the project?
            * Have you developed a connection with a potential adviser in the host country who has knowledge of the research topic and access to other appropriate contacts in the field?
            * Do you have the necessary academic/field-specific background to undertake the proposed research?
            * Do you have sufficient language skills for the project being proposed and to serve the basic purposes of the Fulbright Program? If not, how will you accomplish these goals?
            * You should consider that, even if a country indicates that English will be sufficient for carrying out the proposed project, for purposes of engaging with your host community, at least a basic level of language skill should be obtained prior to leaving the United States for the host country.
            * What are your plans for improving your language skills, if they are not adequate at the time of application?
            * Are there any possible sensitive topics or feasibility concerns that the project could provoke?
            * Candidates applying through U.S. institutions are urged to consult professors in their field of study or faculty members with experience in the host country, as well as their Fulbright Program Advisers, about the feasibility of their proposed projects. At-Large applicants should consult similarly qualified persons in their fields.
            * Crafting your proposal:
            * Be clear and concise. The individuals reading the proposal want applicants to get to the point about the 'who, what, when, where, why, and how' of the project. Avoid discipline-specific jargon and ensure your application can be clearly understood by a general audience.
            * Organize the statement carefully.
            * Don't make reviewers search for information. We urge you to have several people read and critique your Statement of Grant Purpose, including a faculty adviser, a faculty member outside your discipline, a fellow student, and/or a colleague.
            * "
            * here is award description for my selected award and host country: "The Fulbright New Zealand U.S. Open Study/Research Awards are for U.S. students to undertake postgraduate study or research at New Zealand institutions. Grantees are selected on the basis of academic excellence, leadership potential, and ambassadorial qualities.
            * Applicants may wish to either: a) enroll in a graduate degree program at a New Zealand university; b) carry out research towards a U.S. graduate degree; or, c) carry out an independent study/research project while being affiliated with a New Zealand higher education or research institution. Applicants currently pursuing U.S. doctoral degrees must indicate in their applications how their intended research in New Zealand will contribute to their doctoral programs. Applicants must clearly articulate their future plans, and express a compelling reason for coming to New Zealand for their research, as opposed to any other country. Applicants must clearly specify the wider impact of their project, and how it will enhance the relationship between the two countries.
            * While applicants proposing independent study/research will be considered, preference will be given to those proposing graduate degree enrollment or research toward a US PhD.
            * Due to the hands-off nature of independent research in New Zealand, undergraduate/recent graduates proposing independent research must have the academic maturity, rigor, and depth of knowledge to work independently without close guidance from their supervisor. They must be 18 by the start of their grant, and exhibit a high level of subject knowledge and personal/academic initiative. Applicants must also articulate a clear plan and outcome for their research. It is still important that grantees have strong support from their host institution and supervisor."
            * Now ill answer some of these questions the instructions ask about:
            * With whom do you propose to work?
            * - I am focused on independent research like the award emphasizes, however I will seek mentorship and community with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab and Empathic Computing Lab at the University of Auckland.
            * What do you propose to do?
            * -  I am proposing independent research at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, focusing on enhancing human connection across time and space through innovative digital tools. My project centers on developing a user-driven event notification system that allows individuals to stay connected in a more personalized and meaningful way. For example, users can create events, like 'I'm going fishing,' and notify subscribers who are interested in that specific event. This system offers a flexible way to stay connected, even when interests don't always align in frequency. In my case, I only want to join my friend James for fishing occasionally, so instead of him needing to invite me each time, I can subscribe to his 'fishing' event and be notified only when it happens, allowing for spontaneous yet tailored social interactions. This system would empower individuals to maintain closer connections with their social circles and discover new opportunities for interaction.
            * - If time allows I would like to research and build other projects too. Such as a project focused on how to keep the presence felt in person except over long distances.
            * - Also if time allow I would like to research and experiment with emerging technologies like brain computer interfaces in regards to human connection. However, the main focus is on persisting already existent in person connections across distance without introducing new hardware. New hardware research would be secondary since the focus is on maintaining connections between people without adding new hardware (because that can be expensive and intrusive and difficult)
            * What is innovative about the research? What will this research contribute to the field/discipline?
            * - This research is tackling maintaining human connection with a focus on the connections instead of a focus on the technology. These connections already exist - now how can technology be used to maintain those connections across time and space without requiring the users to change their lives. It's focused on extending rather than forcing people to change.
            * - The research will connect people. And in this field, it will emphasize the importance of user experience. Lack of connection with loved ones can be as simple as them not wanting to use a confusing technology.
            * What are the specific research goals and methodologies?
            * - To investigate how a user-driven event notification system and other technology can enhance long-distance communication and presence between individuals.
            * - To analyze the effects of connection-focused technology on the perceived emotional connection during remote interactions.
            * - Conduct qualitative interviews with people in my home country and in New Zealand to assess their experiences with current communication technologies.
            * - Develop and iteratively test prototypes of a novel communication platform that enhances long-distance connections, incorporating user feedback through A/B testing and usability studies to optimize design and functionality.
            * What is important or significant about the project?
            * - There is a pretty serious loneliness epidemic which can be the lead cause of many other mental issues we see. This research is working towards solutions for that.
            * - As technology advances, we become more and more dependent on it. We need solutions that connect us by making us more dependent on each other rather than more dependent on the technology.
            * - In the future we will travel to other planets and we will need ways to stay connected with loved ones across distances.
            * What contribution will the project make toward the Fulbright goal of promoting cultural exchange and mutual understanding?
            * - The project is all about human connection. Much connection is easily lost - connections that can promote cultural exchange and mutual understand - often through relationships - love or just friendship or acquaintances. This project's research is focused on fostering and maintaining relationships over time and space to promote Fulbright's defined goals.
            * When will you carry out the project? Include a feasible timeline.
            * - Based on this specific award's timelines. From late January/early February 2025 to around October 2025.
            * Where do you propose to conduct your study or research? Why did you choose this location?
            * - I am proposing independent research at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. I chose this location because I will seek mentorship and community with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab and Empathic Computing Lab at the University of Auckland. Their work and publications are directly related to my focus area.
            * Why do you want to undertake this project?
            * - Staying connected with the people I care about across time and space has always been difficult. I have worked on various failed projects to address this problem. I have discussed this problem with dozens of people and they all have the same issue. I worked in a research department focused on emerging technology which further emphasized how people need to change in some drastic way just to connect with loved ones - and while i love predicting how emerging technologies will play out in the future - I know there are non-emerging technologies that can be created now to solve these issues of connection.
            * - Much of this problem is two things: 1) an alignment or scheduling problem between individuals and 2) a problem of what current technology makes people focus their attention on (clickbait feeds instead of connecting with people)
            * What are your qualifications for carrying out this project?
            * - I have a bachelors in Computer Science
            * - I have worked at various companies as a fullstack developer building various different technologies
            * - I have worked on and thought about social technologies most of my adult life
            * - My most recent job was in a research department focused on emerging technology. 
            * How will your project help further your academic or professional development?
            * - I align my academic and professional development based on where my heart takes me. My passions and heart are focused on technology that truly connects people. This project is the next step of this journey.
            * How will you engage with the host country community? Give specific ideas that relate to your own personal or professional interests.
            * - I aim to fully immerse myself in New Zealand’s culture and build meaningful connections across a broad spectrum of society—from academics and professionals to local shop owners and people I meet in everyday life. I believe that genuine human connection begins with curiosity and kindness, which are core aspects of my personal values.
            * - I plan to exchange ideas with my host community in a way that is empathetic and non-intrusive, always considering the cultural context. I love discussing a wide range of topics, from emerging technology to spirituality, daily routines, and life’s simple pleasures. These conversations will offer me the chance to share my own knowledge and experiences while learning how these subjects are viewed and practiced in New Zealand. By fostering meaningful dialogue, I hope to bridge cultural gaps and create a deeper mutual understanding.
            * Design a feasible project: You must demonstrate that your research strategy is viable, including its content, methodology, and time frame.
            * Address the following points:
            * How will the culture and politics of the host country impact the work?
            * - Human connection happens everywhere on Earth and the culture and politics of New Zealand has its own unique flavor that will help inform the technologies built and research done.
            * Will the resources of the host country support the project?
            * - Yes, the resources of the host country will help tremendously - although, I am not asking for much and specifically chose New Zealand because their award focuses on researchers that can be independent.
            * Have you developed a connection with a potential adviser in the host country who has knowledge of the research topic and access to other appropriate contacts in the field?
            * - I am currently working on developing a connection with a potential adviser. If connection is made, i will edit this statement.

            * Current subprojects:
                * an event-based notification system that fosters spontaneous yet intentional social interactions. Users can define events, such as "I'm going fishing," and others can subscribe to be notified only when that specific event occurs.
                * minimal co-presence no matter where you are in space
                * simple app to let others know you are thinking about them
            * That's how i usually explain it in professional setting. In non-professional setting, i say this:
            * "initially being manifested by shmoji as he tries to build all the things he feels called to build + art
            * trying to build something in cyberspace that feels like a real place
            * trying to build technology to connect people
            * trying to build an everything app
            * trying to build something that is still useful or beautiful even once we augment with BCI
            * building a home and a community - no matter where you are physically
            * so, not really one single thing. And these are just some things shmoji is interested in, they wont limit what whyspia is and becomes"

        * List 3 of your most exceptional achievements
          * Even if nothing comes of it, everything I've built for whyspia. Nothing complicated. Just basic frontend and backend code. But slowly but surely turning ideas I've had for years to life feels good.
          * All the work at Ideamarket. Was a protocol holding over a million dollars in investments and I built and maintained basically everything. Although, money is just what is signal to others, I found it exceptional because the vision of the project was at the edge of innovation at the time. Trying to decentralize credibility. Very similar to X's Community Notes mixed with prediction markets.
          * My coding YouTube channel. I saw many people go from noob to better than me at coding. Stuck poor with bad jobs to being in better paying coding positions. Also a little community formed from it which was nice and provided a place for people to get real-time help with code questions. I'm finding years later this has compounded so that I have a good network of people to refer to others who need developers.
        * What will you work on if you were accepted to the program? Explain it in 1-2 sentences as simply as possible
          * Human alignment. Helping people find a home or community by bridging the gap between people separated by space and time.
        * Why are you the best person in the world to work on this?
          * I've been working on it for over 1-2 years. Left my well-paying job at Fidelity April 2024 to make this my main focus.
          * More than anything, I'm the best person in the world for this because I am working on it in order to solve clear issues I see in my own life and then if it can help others too, then amazing.
          * For many people, they kind of separate their work and home, but I'm specifically building this for my home. For my community. But it's open source so anyone can use it or fork it.

        * If selected, what will success look like once the fellowship period ends?
          * MVP of the actual technology (which already has a lot of progress)
          * i personally am using the technology weekly (not counting experiments)
          * completed at least one experiment with other people using the technology to see if we find it useful
          * Is it enabling connections based on shared interests and availability? Is it bridging gaps caused by busy schedules or changing priorities?
          * I'd also love to have measures of success more unrelated to technology, but I'm not as good in that domain. But I have ideas around services where people can go to be heard or go to listen to others
        * What might failure look like? What could be some of the original mistakes of your project?
          * i dont even use the technology i created
          * no one uses the technology or finds it useful
          * i dont expect this to happen before the fellowship period ends, but if in a few years I dont find myself in a place where i feel grounded, aligned, and resonant with people around me - then i failed. Ideally, I do find myself in that place and have done the same for many others.
          * Maybe it is mistake to not make this into another platform like Facebook. Instead im focused on building it for my home and my community.
          * Never adding private data to the technology. This is a must, but not priority in beginning.
          * The point of the project is to facilitate and enhance real connections. If the the technology ends up intrusively pulling the focus itself so people are more alone and disconnected, then that is failure.
        * Describe something that you find beautiful in the world.
          * Pretty much everything. The mountains are high up there in the beauty scale. Science and the little details always captivate me. How a computer works from the ground up is beautiful. Life is beautiful.
          * If I had to choose something specific, I'd probably say the teahouse that was just built at the Akiya Collective. An artist came and built it on the land from scratch. I'll be visiting there in Japan in a few months, so I'm excited to see it in person!

          * The problem I would focus on is spontaneous low-energy alignment, heart alignment, and community alignment. We often underestimate the social energy of our various interactions and how this can lead to missed connections. A year ago I built technology for spontaneous low-energy alignment where any person can create tags that they can share which then notifies any person following each tag. I would love to continue this work. However, now I am working on both technology and physical spaces for heart and community alignment - addressing the issue of struggling to connect with the life path of your heart and the separate issue of explicitly wanting community, but not being able to find any aligned community. I think the solution for all of these revolves around spaces you can visit and slow down and reconnect with yourself. My innovative alignment technology solutions could be super valuable here, but at the same time, technology is not the focus or end goal.
        * my ai filtered response - from Grok3
          * I’m tackling the challenge of feeling disconnected—from our heart, our communities, and those effortless moments of connection we crave. A year ago, I built a notification system where people could share tags to spark low-effort connections with others, no social burnout required. Now, I’m taking that further by creating both digital tools and physical spaces to address two big issues: struggling to feel in tune with your true path (‘heart alignment’) and wanting a community that feels like home but not finding it (‘community alignment’). The solution? Spaces—online and IRL—where people can slow down, reflect, and reconnect. My prior tech can help make it happen, but the real goal isn’t the technology—it’s fostering human alignment that lasts.
      * Socious Pilot Round project description/application
        * try 1 - overview
          * I'm the founder of whyspia, a nonprofit dedicated to creating heart-aligning community spaces—physical hangout spots and potentially digital hubs—where any visitor can connect, find alignment with life, and just hangout without pressure to spend money or socialize in traditional ways. We’re raising funds to kickstart these spaces, blending the chill vibe of a coffee shop or student union with a restorative twist, so people can just be themselves, whether that’s quietly doing their own thing, getting help with heart alignment, or making serendipitous connections.
          * This cause is everything to me because of three main reasons. One, it's not always easy to vibe with life. More precisely, it's not always easy to feel aligned and connected enough with the people, places, and rhythms of your specific daily life. Two, everyone I speak to seems to agree that it's not easy to find an aligned community. There's people out there that explicitly want a community and are searching, but just can't find anything that resonates. There needs to be better mechanisms for finding community. Three, there needs to be more spaces where you can do whatever you want—art, studying, or just watching YouTube—while being in the presence of other people, without the requirement to spend money or socialize in traditional ways.
          * The funds will help us bring whyspia to life by renting and maintaining our first physical space—a restorative hub with quiet and social zones—where people can connect and feel at home. Most of the money will secure this space, with some funds going toward exploring ways to support folks seeking heart alignment through community and occasional events. Ideally, we will eventually own property for this. However, until enough funds are obtained for that, we will simulate and experiment with this space through rental.

      * Vibecamp Art/Project Grant Proposal Form
        * Pitch us your idea! Be as descriptive (and creative!) as possible:
          * I would like to setup a whyspia hub for the entirety of Vibecamp 2025. The vision of whyspia is to create heart aligning community spaces. The planned space for Vibecamp consists of:
          * 1) a nonquiet area
          * 2) a quiet area
          * This comes from the mission statement of whyspia to create "sanctuaries where individuals can slow down, pursue personal interests (like art, studies, or literally anything), and reconnect with what feels alive without financial or social barriers - WHILE enjoying the presence of other people closeby."
          * The quiet area is pretty simple because quietness is the main point, while people just do what they want. The nonquiet area is a bit more complex. There will be two physical boards:
          * 1) ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTION BOARD
            * a sign saying "what do you explicitly want to share with others to increase chances of alignment and connection" and then give the options:
            * DESIRES/HELP (what do you want or what do you need help with that could be shared to increase the chances you get what you want or get help) - i could provide example for people to see.
            * WANT_YOU_TO_KNOW_TAGS. These are lil signals of things you explicitly want others to know, but not necessarily a desire or something you need help with. Maybe you dont necessarily want to create an entire event, but you want to talk about a niche topic - you can mention this here and maybe a connection could happen! As the host and a connector, I'll be doing my best to help make connections happen even more!
            * QR code for people to add and track posts in some whyspia app
            * PLACE (only in app maybe). Share your location with a timestamp of how long will be there.
            * STATUS (only in app maybe). Share a status. Similar to discord statuses.
          * 2) QUEST BOARD - give and take quests!
            * maybe just have a board and way for people to write a quest and stick it to board
            * CATEGORIES people can tag on their quests
              * quest with rewards vs no rewards
              * quest for infinite questers vs a fixed number of questers vs just one quester
            * if more categorizing needed...maybe i can bring folders...or containers you can put stuff in?? (helppp i need advice here)
          * I was also pondering on being a space where people can go read/discover Vibecamp events completely in person without needing to look at their phone...but uncertain - I'd maybe need help or to talk that idea out.
        * Please give us an estimate of costs, with a breakdown of where they'd be going, to the best of your ability:
          * Not gonna lie, I have no idea, but I'll do my best.
          * Materials and Equipment ($1000): Supplies for the Welcome Center, Alignment and Connection Board, and Quest Board (e.g., poster boards, markers, signage, QR code printing), plus basic furniture if needed (e.g., folding tables, chairs).
          * Technology Development ($200): Mainly hosting costs for the backend. Also, just incentive to put my time towards development of the app. Which could be good or bad...no idea if i should focus on that or the physical materials and equipment...or something else...
          * Maybe volunteers to help me? ($100): 2 volunteers, $50 each for as long as they feel called to volunteer? Not certain about this tbh.
          * So maybe like $1300 total?? That could be way too little or way too much, I have no idea.

        * Project Abstract (300 words max)
            * whyspia is a nonprofit initiative dedicated to creating and maintaining heart-aligning community spaces—physical hubs with digital extensions—that serve as simple hangout spots where individuals can slow down, reconnect with life, and just hangout without pressure to spend money or socialize in traditional ways. Founded on the belief that feeling aligned and connected to the people, places, and rhythms of your specific daily life is fundamental for wellness yet elusive for many, whyspia seeks to address three critical needs: the challenge of vibing with daily life, the difficulty of finding resonant communities, and the scarcity of spaces where people can engage in personal pursuits—be it art, study, or relaxation—amid the presence of others, free of traditional expectations. These spaces, inspired by the relaxed ambiance of coffee shops, student unions, and community centers, blend quiet and social zones to foster serendipitous connections and personal agency.  The project’s methodology begins with small-scale, event-based experiments to prototype whyspia’s vision of heart-aligning community spaces, starting with a three-day experiment at Vibecamp 2025 on June 19th. This initial setup will feature a physical whyspia hub with two zones: a nonquiet “Welcome Center" and a quiet area. The Welcome Center will host an Alignment and Connection Board—where attendees can share niche interests, desires, or needs via a physical board linked to a simple app—alongside a Quest Board for posting and accepting informal challenges, with or without rewards, to spark serendipitous interactions. Prior to Vibecamp, whyspia will test smaller gatherings to refine this model, though specifics are still evolving. The long-term goal is to secure a permanent physical space—ideally owned property—after validating the concept. Technology will play an optional supporting role, starting with a lightweight app for spontaneous low-energy alignment and potentially expanding into a digital commons that mirrors the physical spaces’ ethos, amplifying accessibility and connection.
        * Alignment with d/acc. Explain how your proposal supports decentralized, democratic, differential, and defensive acceleration. Which of the “4ds” does your project embody and how. If a “d” is not relevant, explain why this aligns with d/acc’s broader goals. If your project introduces tension with a “d” (e.g., confidentiality in bio), justify it clearly.
        * I apologize, but I'm going to be lazy. I feel the project is so early-stage, I can't give the answer you're looking for. I can say that whyspia completely aligns with Ethereum Localism. That is what whyspia is moving towards, except in the format discussed in the abstract. I'll mention a few other points poking out. For differential acceleration, we are unique because we are focused on heart-alignment. For this, technology is an optional appendage, not a requirement. For defensive acceleration, that is why we are focused on creating grounded community spaces and then building technology for the community. The ideal is users completely own their data while still maintaining a slick user experience. For more context: https://github.com/whyspia/whyspia-journal-and-docs/blob/main/mission.md
        * Why Is It Important? What new capabilities or directions could it unlock if successful?
        * - More people who have community at all - More people with an aligned community - More trust - New format for building technology. For your community/frens/family opposed to for capitalistic systems or just open source anons - More people vibing with life (as defined in our mission) - Cost-free hubs where people can play (especially with technology and art since that is most of my background) - Less loneliness - More people chasing the path of their heart rather than getting trapped be degenerative systems
        * Why Hasn’t It Been Done Yet?
        * No one wants to fund something like this lmao. For funding, you need to completely guarantee you are going to add value. Places for play do not fit the bill. Helping people vibe more with life is too abstract to confirm a value-add. Helping people find an aligned community helps the people, but does it help investors?? Aside from that, I think there are several groups doing stuff like this with success, but just not in the specific format whyspia is using.
        * What makes you (and/or your team) uniquely suited to this work?
        * I'm going to keep working towards this until the day I die. I'm currently in Japan for 2 months with no commitments other than bringing this to life. My fullstack dev background helps. Spending tons of time thinking on society at all scales helps too.
        * Timeline and Key Milestones
            * Key Proposal Deliverable(s) and Goals 
             Deliverables: 
            1) Local Test Events (April-June 2025 or post-Vibecamp) 
			 Outcome 
			 Host 2-3 small-scale pop-up events (e.g., in local parks or social spaces) aiming for at least 5-10 attendees each, featuring a Welcome Center, Alignment and Connection Board, and Quest Board. Tangible Output A functional prototype of whyspia’s dual-zone (quiet and nonquiet) hangout space, plus initial feedback and engagement data (e.g., board usage) to refine the model. 2) Vibecamp 2025 Event (June 19-22, 2025) Outcome Establish a fully operational whyspia hub at Camp Ramblewood, MD, for 3 days, serving as many of the hundreds of Vibecamp attendees as possible. Tangible Output A reusable physical setup (tent, signage, furniture), a lightweight app or digital tool for board interactions, and an interaction dataset to assess impact and scalability. 3) Post-Event Analysis and Report (July 2025) Outcome Compile feedback, metrics, and lessons from all events into a concise report. Tangible Output A public-facing summary detailing attendance, engagement (e.g., connections made), and attendee-reported alignment gains, guiding next steps.
        * Budget and Support Required
            * Total Amount Requested / Breakdown whyspia seeks a total of $7,500 in funding to launch its initial phase of heart-aligning community spaces, spanning small-scale test events and a three-day experiment at Vibecamp 2025 (June 19-22). This amount will cover critical costs for prototyping and validating the model, ensuring we can refine it for broader impact. Below is a detailed breakdown of how funds will be allocated: 4) Event Space and Rentals ($3,000) What Rental fees for temporary spaces at Vibecamp 2025 and 2-3 smaller pre-Vibecamp test events. Where Vibecamp (Camp Ramblewood in Darlington, MD) and local spots (e.g., parks or rental spaces in my area). How Covers a modest Vibecamp footprint (e.g., $1,500 for a tent/setup for 3 days) and $500/event for 3 smaller tests ($1,500 total). Funds ensure accessible, no-cost hangout zones with quiet and nonquiet areas. 5) Materials and Equipment ($1,500) What Supplies for the Welcome Center, Alignment and Connection Board, and Quest Board (e.g., poster boards, markers, signage, QR code printing), plus basic furniture if needed (e.g., folding tables, chairs). Where Sourced locally or online, deployed at all events. How $1,000 for Vibecamp (larger scale, durable signage) and $500 for smaller tests. These tools spark interaction and embody whyspia’s low-pressure, inclusive vibe, keeping costs lean by reusing materials across events. 6) Technology Development ($2,000) What Initial setup of a lightweight app or digital platform to track board posts and engagement. Where Developed remotely by the founder. How $1,500 for minimal app design/hosting and $500 for printing/tech setup (QR codes, instructions). This optional digital layer enhances accessibility and data collection without overcomplicating the bootstrap phase. Plus, the founder is an experienced fullstack developer. 7) Promotion and Volunteer Support ($1,000) What Marketing (flyers, social media) and modest volunteer stipends. Where Online (e.g., event on the Meetup app) and physical handouts at events. How $500 for promo (e.g., $200 printing, $300 digital costs) and $500 for 5-10 volunteers across events (e.g., $50 each). Keeps whyspia visible and supported without heavy overhead. Total Requested: $7,500 Funds will jumpstart whyspia’s proof-of-concept phase, covering essentials while staying true to our low-cost, high-impact ethos. Any surplus will extend pre-Vibecamp testing or enhance Vibecamp’s setup (e.g., extra seating). This investment seeds a scalable model, paving the way for permanent hubs and broader community reach.
        * Optional: Visual, Demo and/or Paper
        * Hmm…I could submit demo of the actual social technology based around human alignment that I’ve already built, but i think the mission statements are more alive than the tech: https://www.whyspia.com/mission
    * [[2025-04-27]] Edge Esmeralda Cosmos Grant thing
        * Briefly, why are you interested in attending Edge Esmeralda?
            * I previously worked on Ideamarket, where the main mission was a marketplace of ideas to decentralized credibility - and now I'm working on a new version with the CEO. Also, my main mission in life now is to build community spaces for reconnecting with life...which seems relevant to Edge Esmeralda.
        * What specific questions do you hope to explore during this program?
            * Can explicitly turning opinions into data allow truth to be discovered 100x faster? Can explicitly turning desires into data allow for more alignment and connection between people?
        * What unique perspectives would you bring to this gathering?
            * The perspective of someone who built two different web3 versions of the marketplace of ideas - one based on tokenizing everything and one based on posts as NFTs and a smart contract rating system. Also, I would bring the perspective of someone who built multiple social technology apps based around alignment, fun, and connection - and then pivoted to a larger more-alive vision that isn't JUST building tech.
    * [[2025-05-01]] Fractal Campus Accelerator
        * Who is in your founding crew and what are their roles? You’ll need a crew of at least two people (including you) to apply
            * me: founder...my role has been 2 months in Tokyo with no commitments except to bring this to life most recently.
            * i have some potential others for a founding crew, but no one has committed as a founding crew...because that's a more serious commitment ya know. I'm going to do some asking around though.
        * Tell us more about what you’re building (For example:• What’s your vision for your campus?• What resources might you draw on? (eg a friend’s existing living room for your third space; a network of entrepreneurs that you can recruit teachers from, etc)• If you’ve already made progress, what does that look like?	*(FYI it’s OK for your other crew members to copy-paste your answer if they want)*)
			* NARROW VISION: a third place where people can slow down, reconnect with what is alive for them, and do literally whatever they want - all amid the presence of other people and without need to spend money or socialize in traditional ways.
				* The entire vision/mission is here: https://www.whyspia.com/mission
				* Here is the ideal physical space ive pondered on: https://paragraph.com/@whyspia/the-ideal-physical-space-for-whyspia
				* Here is some brainstorming on a "popup event" version of whyspia: https://paragraph.com/@whyspia/brainstorming-the-first-popup-event-for-whyspia
				* resources i can draw on:
				    * im a connector and can draw on my network of frens. Have gotten frens jobs just by asking other frens
				    * most my history is as a dev, so i can code stuff
				    * most recently, i have raised some funds through a mix of networking and the Cardano ecosystem in Japan (not sure how much yet though)
				    * The most recent progress is this funding. The next key thing I need to do is host a more "popup event" version of whyspia...but i feel slightly conflicted because im not an event host. HOWEVER, im going to try and host something in Tokyo in these last 2 weeks that im here.
				    * Before this, I spent a year building social technology. I have no idea if it will end up used for whyspia or not. Not really planning on it. But that year of my life and tech is still very related to whyspia. Especially in terms of spaces where people can just play with tech and art and creating.
				    * Aside from that, I track a good bit of the progress in the blog: https://paragraph.com/@whyspia
			    * tell us a short story about a project that you worked on in the past and crushed it!
			        * Definitely Ideamarket. Around 2020 I joined their Discord, asked if there were any jobs, and then completed a bounty to prove i was good for the job. After that I built frontends, backends, smart contracts, and all kinds of other things for the project. There was like a million dollars in the protocol at one point or something like that. Although, I dont feel THAT confident sharing this because im not a big fan of coding nowadays.
			        * I feel much more confident in this story...but it wasnt really a "project": https://shmoji.substack.com/p/gather-the-frens-and-then-disappear
			    * short video telling what draws you to this program
			        * https://youtu.be/80pN4J-gR3g
			    * any other questions or comments for us
			        * - There was an event here in Tokyo that was just for people to meet and find cofounders. It was only intended for-profit though, which I wasnt interested in. That could be a good niche for you guys to help out in.
			    *  Tuition is $600. Would you require financial aid to participate? Let us know what amount you would feel comfortable paying.
			        * Well I dont know how much im getting from Socious Fund yet...so it's hard to say. That would go towards hosting 1-3 popup events. I mainly dont want to risk not having funds for those events. I'd be most comfortable paying whatever feels right after attending, but for now I'll say $100-200 and if by that time my money is looking different, then of course pay full tuition. I may have to choose this versus Vibecamp *tear tear*
    * [[2025-05-07]] *Inner River*: Art Residency at Life Itself Hub, Bergerac, August 2025 - Application form
        * Tell us a brief story of your current chapter in third person. Who are you as a character in this story, and who are you becoming? What are the great questions and mysteries in the chapters ahead, and what is your quest?
            * there is a dude named shmoji. he is trying to bring whyspia to life. whyspia is community spaces for reconnecting with life. that is his quest.
            * he is sadly kind of a tragic character in ways, but also lucky in other ways. Bad mystery chronic health issues and pain. However, this struggle pushes him to bring to life what he sees is needed in life and opens the door to nontraditional experiences.
            * shmoji is becoming more and more of a connector. he loves people. if he dies before significant progress is made on whyspia, he will be happy that he connected with as many people as he could. if he survives fairly long, he hopes to create a future where it's much easier for ANYONE to connect with life. By life, he specifically means the people, places, and rhythms of each person's specific daily life. he likes to point this out because you connect with more than just people in daily life; all connections matter.
            * the big question is if whyspia will come to life or not. there's also the side quest of if he will ever figure out his health stuff. he tried making that his main quest for years, but it didnt work and was not a fulfilling life
        * What's your current relationship to art and creative practice? What are your intentions, curiosities & wishes? What are you excited about creating and contributing to the world?
            * To be honest, I always feel mixed about art/creative practice. In a few different ways:
            * 1) often I want to create, but the energy isnt there. I can force myself, but that doesnt feel right. But sometimes it can take like a month to get that spark of energy back...which then leads to guilt about abandoning that creative work.
            * 2) it's hard to get myself to just do art that isnt connected to adding value at some point. Hard to just play. Especially when considering limitation of time.
            * 3) my relationship with whyspia is different than creating other things. i plan to stick with it until the day i die. i know my heart and whole self is in it 100%. im also hoping it leads to a grounded environment where it's easier to just play and create and learn
            * My wish is literally what i intend to create - whyspia. Also is what im excited about creating and contributing to the world. A grounded place where anyone can just create and learn all the time while being surrounded by people doing the same. Personally, finally have time to practice digital drawing, 3D modeling, and a few other niches I've dipped my toes in but never had enough time to practice significantly.
        * What inspires you to be a part of the residency? How do you imagine it supporting you as a person and as a creative being?
            * Life Itself feels like a mentor. Being in the community seems like the perfect place for a character like me with the quest i have. I'd really like to explore how a project like this even survives at all. I've bumped into several funding opportunities for whyspia, but then people start demanding metrics...and tracking every little things seems to kill the aliveness of what im trying to do. So, the mentorship support potential is immense.
            * In another domain, i want to still be kind to the creative part of myself without NEEDING the social spaces im trying to bring to life. It feels like when a loved one is sick and you cant do anything about it. i want to know how to let my creative self PLAY more and this feels like a good space for unlocking that.
        * In this community residency, our creative and reflective exploration is supported by living and learning together, taking turns cooking for the community, caring for common spaces, etc. Tell us about your experience of living and/or participating in community. What have been the biggest gifts and challenges of community in your experience?
            * Biggest Gifts:
                * i like simple presence of other people while i do my own stuff. This is the biggest gift for me.
                * Friendship
                * Spontaneous interactions and adventures and plan-making
            * Biggest Challenges:
                * Distractions and interruptions. When you are incredibly focused on some creative process/work and then it is interrupted. But it is so worth it for community imo. Plus, you could totally set up explicit norms around that.
                * When it's a community that's not explicitly there together (like the sharehouse im in currently in Japan) it can be hard to deeply connect with people living there.
        * Group time can be emotionally challenging. How do you feel about your capacity and availability to emotionally care for yourself and others in community?
            * I feel confident in my ability to communicate on this topic in real time. In fact, I enjoy providing care in the form of listening to others. And due to my chronic pain stuff, I'm quite good at caring for myself.
    - Life Itself Practicum 2025 - Application
        - Why would you like to do a Practicum with Life Itself?
            - I want to be a part of a conscious co-living community and experience the lifestyle, so I can become a part of a permanent version one day as both a community member and someone that helps everyone else flourish. I have visions around a third place I want to open one day.
		    - I want to help other people do what feels alive for them and I feel this may be a part of that journey.
		    - I have a friend that lives in France that I'd maybe get to see haha
		    - I'm a connector. But all my past experience is in software. Trying to figure out how to branch away from tech and into a career where I connect people and help regenerative communities flourish.

		- share what ur working on
			- I am shmoji. I'm just a creator with a professional background in coding, innovation, and emerging technologies. Since about 2016 I have worked on various projects in my free time. They eventually evolved into social tech projects for connecting people because that's what I care about. Over time, I realized I had no intention for these projects to be for-profit, so I simply build for myself, my friends, my family, and my community. Even more core than that, the strongest reason I build these complex projects is because I feel something calls me to do it. Simple as that.
			- Which leads me to my current project. Tangibly, I'm building a Windows desktop environment. In browsers, you can traverse the web using URLs. With the system I'm building, you traverse all of cyberspace using user-owned symbols/locations. It's like taking Obsidian or any note-taking app and integrating it by default into your computer at a low level. When you create a note in a note-taking app, that note has a title, which is how you find it later. You can do this same thing in the system I am making. But you can also tie an entire app to a symbol. Then, you can choose if that symbol/location tied to you stays private or make it public.
			- I love to imagine a future where I can browse the mindmaps of all my friends and it becomes even more exciting when it's more than just text notes - you can see 3D worlds, apps, 2D games, and more. I sense this would unlock creativity and provide a home for creativity in cyberspace - instead of an endless feed.
			- The symbolic navigation system is core to the project, but I also want to integrate a few sub-projects that are also evolved from past projects. Another key: a place where people can share what is on their mind. For example, I share the 5 specific topics on my mind right now, increasing the chances for connection on these topics. I made an app like this for Vibecamp 2025 and some connections formed during the event; was pretty cool.
			- I will say confidently that this is more like a weird art project, not some for-profit thing. So, consider with that in mind. But I move to Japan in the next few months, after going for two months early this year. While I was there previously, I began running coworking-like events titled "do what feels alive for you." Once I move there I fully intend to continue running these events and take this project with me as an optional community technology. I think it could be something that:
			- unlocks and gives creativity a home
			- creates an infrastructure for "place" in cyberspace
			- increases chances of connection between people
		- current financial situation

Using the remaining savings to start Japanese language school and get moved over there by start of 2026. My big challenges is my student loans and medical bills. I spent over $20,000 in medical bills in 2024. I think I have got my chronic health crap managed now, but sometimes it's unpredictable...and definitely taking a risk by chasing my dream to get moved to Japan.
			- Mainly just that I'm about to move to Japan and start Japanese language school for 1-2 years while having most likely no income.
			- I would just keep working on it in freetime as I have my whole life with projects. Again, it's more like art for me. I'm just chasing my muse.
