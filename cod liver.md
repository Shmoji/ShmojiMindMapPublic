  * **Risks**
    * There is one situation in which high levels of vitamin A are not recommended and that is the condition of certain types of **liver disease** in which there is altered vitamin A metabolism. This is frequently the case with **alcoholism**. Alcoholics should not take high doses (not more than 1-1.5 tablespoons of regular cod liver oil) and what they do take should be accompanied by zinc supplements. The enzymes needed for vitamin A metabolism in the liver are zinc dependent.
  * **What does it do for body?**
    * Replenish the destroyed DHA and retinol (when does this happen? it seems tinnitus is symptom)
    * the nutrient cofactors in liver are essential to copper-iron metabolism. Liver contains necessary cofactors to put BAD iron to use. Excessive copper can trigger histamine response and other issues.
    * Excellent source of [[vitamin D]] (best source), vitamin A, copper, zinc, magnesium, and potassium.
  * **How much and how often to eat?**
    * Only eat once or twice per week. Any more could be toxic
    * Eat 4oz for 1 meal. This is just 1 can
  * Notes
    * Cod tastes far more mild than beef, but other liver works too
