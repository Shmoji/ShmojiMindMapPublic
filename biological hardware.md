  * differences between a device that uses living cells on a chip vs fully hardware device
    * biological device is more energy efficient by a large amount

    * sample efficiency. Biological device doesnt compute same as GPU bc they train at inference (one loop). Bc one loop, amount of data you require to train these is a lot less
      * not gonna lie, i dont understand this completely
    * biological devices are cheaper to make and cheaper to run
