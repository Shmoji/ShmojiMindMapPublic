      * CONFUSION: still dont know what time debt is
      * STORY: oo cool the time tombs (and hence the Shrike too i assume) are moving back in time from future

      * Q: what is the All Thing? seems like some universe info hub that debates and passes legislation, but not totally sure.

      * Q: what is fatline? A: instantaneous communication technology. The term is likely a contraction of "Faster Than Light Communication Line," or some similar phrase. Fatline technology utilizes tachyons as it's transmission medium - faster than light particles sent in a burst that decays over time and distance. This burst of decaying tacyons must be converted and decoded by a receiver at the destination. Created by TechnoCore, but Ousters got their own kinda
      * Q: what is the Hegemony? A: seems to be a socio-politico-cultural super-entity for most of WorldWeb (and more)
      * WOAH: i wonder if Hyperion from Ben G was named from these books
      * WOAH: i wonder if farcaster web3 protocol was named from these books
  * omg story moments
    * for 7-8 years Father Dure was repeatedly killed and revived on the Tesla tree thanks to Cruciform
    * Fedmann Kasahd finally doing it with dream girl to only find out she was maybe the Shrike. And his cool fight before that in destroyed spaceship with Ousters. And confusion of that being his future, but dream girl's past somehow
