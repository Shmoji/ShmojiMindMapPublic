  * TODO
    * Get all 3 collectables in final level before fighting phalanx
  * Questions
    * What is stronger: Buster or Ariel Gargoyle or other
  * How TOs
    * minimum bosses to defeat to complete normal ending
      * To unlock Atlantis and Ice Palace, you need defeat Ovnunu, Flame Lord, Flier, and Arma 2
      * Then, defeat Grewon and Crawler to make Phalanx Tower appear. Then go there and beat Phalanx 2 (no 3rd form)
      * Note: it is not just 1 boss each stage to unlock normal ending, you do need Flier and Arma 2
  * Endings
    * There are 4 different endings
    * 1: Beat Phalanx before getting all the Crests. (is this normal ending?)
    * 2: Beat Phalanx with all the Crests, but not all items.
    * 3: Beat Phalanx with all the Crests and items.
    * 4: Beat the Dark Demon
  * Levels
    * General notes
      * There are 4 levels. Each has path A and path B (except Level 1), but the order completed is misleading.
    * Level 2
      * Path B
        * Entrance found by Ground Gargoyle dashing the last fountain statue before boss in level 2
    * Level 3
      * Path B cannot be beaten until you have the Air Crest (cut vines) and Water Crest (survive in water). You get them in level 4 i guess??
    * Level 4
      * Path B
        * Entrance just before boss of Path A. Jump into tornado down below
        * Talisman - where at?
    * Level 5
      * Path B
        * Entrance in the water
    * Level 6

      * How to win
        * Don't stay on platforms, just use them to get eye-level with his head
        * Try to keep hand blasts destroyed, so he stops blocking his head and so they aren't hurting you
        * Use Fang everytime, then quickly switch back to armor or drop below his blast
    * Dark Demon
      * How to win
        * Stick to walls as much as possible, but don't be afraid to fly and shoot too. But walls will eventually turn to spikes
        * Use Fang when he is in demon form and you have a second of safety. Sometimes can use Fang in chariot form, but better to stick with Armor because easy to get hit
        * Use all potions, I did it with 4
      * Boss forms and moves
        * Chariot form
          * Hits to kill while in Ultimate Gargoyle: 100
          * Moves
            * Summons a little ball that follows you everywhere. You can destroy it, but it immediately comes back, so no point.
            * He moves around towards you and his hit box hurts
            * Summons pink circle and then does Sin Rain. Only spot safe is right under him.
          * How to hurt
            * Shoot his upper portion
        * Demon form
          * Hits to kill while in Ultimate Gargoyle: 50
          * Moves
            * Hurls axe-things at you
            * Rocks fall from ceiling
            * Gains i-frames and shoots ball at you that turns what it hits into spikes
