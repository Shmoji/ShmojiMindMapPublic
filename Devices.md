  * Google Home

    * Tools

      * Can add events and ask for today's events that are on Google Calendar for my main email by just using voice

  * Galaxy Watch (Samsung Gear S3) [[Smart Watch]]
    * Tools

      * Can read today's and future events right on wrist (need to sync using Bluetooth to get new events since last sync)
      * Can create little checkmark TODO tasks that are local to watch. I like this for grocery lists and little tasks that don't need to be put in Roam
      * Can see heart rate
      * Can see time and date quickly
    * Issues
      * Most of the time, the phone and watch just wont connect, so nothing will sync, even if bluetooth is good. This very bad when creating events that needs to be synced
      * Bixby (voice control) just doesn't work
