    * poop has little white dots. Not a lot - maybe 5-7 on one or 2 poops. 
  * [[2023-08-07]]
    * poop had like 2-3 white dots spread across 2 poops (not each)
  * [[2023-08-12]]
    * Kinda soft and burnt when coming out. Wipey wipey everytime you get burn feeling. My poop is almost never like this so that's interesting. Possible reasons why: 1) ate Clean Juice cali wrap 2) high lipase and amylase right now for some reason 
  * [[2023-08-22]]
    * morning poop felt hard and spikey - hurt quite a bit on way out. It also had white rice-sized spots all over one poop (there was like 5-6 separate poops). I ate Homewrecker Moes bowl last night
  * [[2023-09-04]]
    * Was maybe constipated, but not sure. Braces made so cant eat much, so that could just mean not much poop. However, i pooped today and it felt hard and spikey on way out. Hurt 4/10. It looked pretty normal tho.
  * [[2023-10-18]]
    * past month poop has been like 5-20 small spheres everytime lol
    * constipation is still a bit there, but not as bad as previously. Maybe 2-3/10. Only ideas why it got better: 1) been consistently working out 2) not been eating much brown rice 3) tbh idek why

Had the most constipated poop ever. Took over 10 minutes and hurt like 4/10 coming out. Mainly looked like a bunch of pellets lol.]]

    * due to acupuncture and maybe chinese supps from acupuncture, been pooping 2 times per day which is good i suppose - wasnt like that in past
    * this morning poop was in pebbles. some of them randomly felt like knives as they came out - or pieces did
    * this afternoon had big poop and part of it also felt like knife. the knife sensation actually traveled from anus to right mid-chest
  * [[2024-05-03]]
    * been pooping twice per day which is good...BUT both poops today felt like knives on way out. Dont think caused by size. Maybe theyre just really dry or something? Some cause ideas 1) the acupuncture supps im taking 2) heavy metals from chocolates i eat
  * [[2024-06-08]]
    * 2nd time this has ever happened - poop came out in pebbles as usual BUT some pebbles were attached by some string-like/hair-like thing. No idea what causes that. I had Cristina's pancit and been eating her food so maybe something with that??
    * also been like 5-6/10 constipated since getting back to dads
  * tracking poops that go smooth bc kinda rare
    * [[2024-06-24]]
      * 1st poop early in morning went smooth for once. only reasons i can think of: 1) smoked weed for first time in forever yesterday 2) pikadilio from Cristina for dinner 3) peanut butter smoothie from smoothie king
  * tracking knife-like poop
    * [[2024-06-17]]
      * had this today at lunch time. was 5-7/10 pain. Only cause i can think if is i had peanut butter smoothie with pea protein yesterday. But i had one day at vibecamp too, but had no smooth at vc - so what is similarity there?

      * had lil bit 2/10 during morning poop. Pondering on what was different: 1) had chicken palak (which is apparently chicken saag) at tandoori bites 2) had C's pikadillio
    * [[2024-06-28]]
      * 1st poop of day around lunch and was like 2-4/10 pain poop. Day before- 1) dinner: shrimp fried rice from nigitori 2) day before lunch: pikadillio and rice (need to learn what type of rice) and some fruits (banana, watermelon, blueberries)
    * [[2024-10-14]]
      * had like 2-3/10 pain poop in morning. Yesterday i had broccoli and mackerel for lunch. Had chicken tanola for dinner. Took black seed oil for first time in while. So maybe it grabbed some metals and out through poop? no idea
    * [[2024-10-22]]
      * about 2-4/10 pain poop, but it went by very quick. Only ideas why: 1) Moes homewrecker bowl which also caused bloating 2) just got back from 4-5 hours of driving yesterday 3) i do think i had black seed oil either yesterday or day before
    * [[2025-03-14]]
      * like 8/10 pain
      * only ideas: 1) ate way too many cheezitz yesterday (they often make tummy gurgle and hurt right after) 2) Post Grape Nuts cereal (i dont think so but who knows)
