  * tracking taking the supplement protocol
    * [[2024-01-09]]
      * started the protocol today
      * lesson learned: dont pour caps into liquid to drink - 12/10 disgusting - i almost puked - it was like Dumbledoor drinking that shiz
      * so i think i need to buy yogurt and try that
      * berberine is also cap that is huge. i poured it into my rice bowl and that worked pretty well. lil nasty still, but not terrible - prob would be terrible in water tho
    * [[2024-01-10]]
      * last 2 days ive felt v good - not sure which supp did it tho.
      * only time pain arised, specifically in gut, was after eating fig bar - interesting
    * [[2024-01-18]]
      * just a general checkin - i seem to be a lot less bloated and less constipated. i often poop 2 times each day which never happened before. but still is slight constipation and bloating happening - especially bloating with wrong foods as usual
    * [[2024-02-19]]
      * i stopped [[prokinetic]] today because supposed to stop at least 7 days before taking triosmart breath test
    * [[2024-02-22]]
      * stopped protocol completely today. Will do breathtest tomorrow. Honestly dont feel like symptoms changed much during this. Potentially even worse constipation and bloating was biggest change.
  * tracking next steps and decisions
    * [[2024-02-28]]
      * i finished sibo protocol and hydrogen numbers only slightly improved. idek if i believe i have sibo. im gonna stop with sibo and cirs for now
      * gonna try acupuncture for my current health issues that bother me
      * also gonna do therapy and see if that has effects just in case
      * will go from there

  * tracking general
    * [[2023-12-28]]
      * about to order everything listed here: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/me in relation to sibo#^P5KigRY1A|sibo protocol i did]]
      * Will do this protocol for 4-6 weeks and track effects on me
      * Although, i went home for holidays and old symptoms came rushing back, so id like to first get that under control where my kidneys and tum dont feel like death - that way i will clearly know if new symptoms are caused by this new protocol or not
  * tracking figuring out sibo diet
    * [[2023-12-29]]
      * some foods are SCD legal, but require proper preparation and even then, may be hard to digest if you have severe digestive issues. Examples: lentils and black beans - both need to be prepared  right and both can still be rough on digestion - but black beans are worse than lentils apparently
      * im thinking about it and i may have to just say screw it for rice. Rice is a definite no-go for SCD, but i feel like i need rice at least occasionally. Might just say screw it.
  * [[tracking breath tests, triosmart, sibo]]
