  * where does it come from?
    * Aspergillus spreads in the environment by releasing conidia which are capable of infiltrating the small alveolar airways of individuals.
    * Gliotoxins are commonly found in environments where mold growth occurs, such as damp and humid areas. They can be present in indoor environments with mold problems, including buildings with water damage, basements, and poorly ventilated spaces. Exposure to gliotoxins can occur through inhalation of airborne spores or direct contact with contaminated materials.
  * what does it do in your body?
    * In order to evade the bodyâ€™s defenses Aspergillus releases Gliotoxin to inhibit the immune system (=prevent the immune system from reacting).
    * Gliotoxin impairs the activation of T-cells. T-Cells are immune cells that protect the body from pathogens.
    * Gliotoxin also induces apoptosis (=a form of programmed cell death) in monocytes (=a type of white blood cell) and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (=T-cell helpers).
    * These impairments can lead to multiple neurological syndromes.
