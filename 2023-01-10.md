    * After trying to clean ears with warm salt water, been hard to hear out of ears for about 3-4 days. Everything is muffled. Tried twice in right ear and it is worse than left. I heard wax breaking up, but not so sure if it came out. Maybe i just moved it deeper in or something. Would it be worth to try with peroxide?
