  * questions
    * can you use manifestation as a tool, but still stay in abundance at the same time? or does desire/thoughts/etc always limit consciousness
      * i dont think so, but you CAN keep the connection to source of abundance
  * good anecdotes
    * Eckhart Tolle: manifesting abundance is not really the right way. Go to the source and allow from the source for abundance if it wishes to manifest in your life
    * You can use manifestation as a tool - but you'll know if you're connected to source or not. It will be playful.
    * Happiness is your true nature. The term happiness as a pointer may not be the best, but if you know what the word truly means when said by someone, you can see beyond limitations of pointer. Happiness is the connectedness with the unmanifested. It is the joy that is not caused by anything out there (including manifesting). Uncaused joy.
    * Consciousness born into thought becomes limited
  * issues people make with manifesting
    * to seek fulfillment or fullness of life through manifesting
