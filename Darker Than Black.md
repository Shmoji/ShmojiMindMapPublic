        * i thought Hei would have gone to Nick's side - im confused why he didnt. Hei said he was lying but i dont think so hmm. Maybe it's bc Nick was killing people.
        * Apparently people with the Meteor fragment cant control themself, but Hei ended up with it so that's confusing
    * S1E24
      * [[2024-01-22]]
        * yo what happened to Mao - did he die?? run away?
        * so the syndicate ran all the governments as well as their own group of contractors all with goal to kill all contractors?? and fighting against Evening Primrose?
    * S1 last episode
      * [[2024-01-23]]
        * never explained what happened to Mao
        * is Hei's sister literally a part of him or just "in his heart"? i think literally

      * [[2024-02-16]]
        * still dont know if theres time travel going on or what. Bc Suou's mom said she cremated Suou's body - so im confused
        * but also maybe Suou is a copy. Or she just has some copied memories idk
        * found it interesting that Mao met Suou's mom in his human form - and that's when his human body was killed and got trapped as cat - whenever Suou died in that explosion
    * Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor E11
      * [[2024-02-19]]
        * they still have not explained anything about blonde intel chick with 2 twin dolls. Also same for murderous guy that turns into big stone body. Also same for intel guy that meets with blonde chick
        * so it seems before meteor impact, Suou didnt exist, but then Shion who was contractor since birth created Suou as clone of himself when meteor crashed and hurt him...so many of Suou's memories were fakes from Shion
    * Darker than Black: Gemini of the Meteor E12
      * [[2024-02-20]]
        * incredibly confusing ending, but insanely relevant to present-day in irl history
        * also i noticed nobody online realized the spiritual aspects of the story. Her name is literally YIN
        * in the end Shion simulated/cloned a new artificial Earth - including all humans. These new people have no idea they are cloned though
        * so lots of stuff around simulation, memory, technology, spirituality, embodiment, emotion, morality, decisions
        * yo why was the magician contractor randomly alive again at very end after being killed - and what was he even up to - apparently working with July and "elites" of some group
    * Darker than Black: Gaiden E4
      * [[2024-02-26]]
        * well now it makes sense why Yin was locked up in S2
        * thinking back to S2, i dont understand completely how Hei saved everyone by choosing Yin
        * found it interesting the Syndicate was apparently created decades ago to prevent the doom story in the Mitaka documents, but lost sight of their goals
  * characters

  * nouns
    * the syndicate
      * apparently who Hei is teamed up with in beginning
    * Pandora
      * UN led research org
  * concepts
    * contractors
      * they have special powers, but have to perform some action after using powers as payment - called remuneration
    * dolls
    * moratorium, moratoria
      * intermediate between a Contractor and a Doll. Moratoria appear to be people with Contractor powers who do not require remuneration as part of their power. Unlike Contractors, they do not have control of their powers, shifting into a hypnotic state of unconsciousness as they use them. Moratoria also suffer from severe mental trauma as a result of their power. According to Mao, the chance of a Moratorium morphing into a Contractor is near zero, but possible. 
    * regressor
      * can lose their contractor abilities somehow, but they can come back too. Stars in the sky allow to see if powers are active or not 
  * story details
    * some sort of event happened and then contractors with special powers appeared and gigantic wall was put up and gov tries to censor a lot of info about wall and contractor
