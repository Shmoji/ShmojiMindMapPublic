  * bitcoin
  * nostr
  * comparing Bitcoin and nostr (quite interesting to me rn)
    * bitcoin is centralized in certain ways. this is because it's money and it needs to be scarce
    * nostr is totally decentralized (apparently). This is because information is non-scarce and most important thing is to prevent censorship
