  * Filipino Food

    * Sopas - C chaped Noodles with sliced up hot dogs and veggies
    * Pancit - Super skinny noodles with small pieces of meat/veggies. Not soupy

    * Sotanghon - basically chicken noodle soup with those tiny tiny noodles and rice and veggies. Usually has this orange flavoring on it but not always
    * Caldareda - Sometimes spicy, potatoes and big pieces of meat
    * Pikadilio - Smally cut up beef, small cube potatoes, can be spicy i think
    * Turan - My fav dessert food
    * Chicken Tinola - chicken, soup, ginger, malunggay leaves (we grow at home - they are tiny dark green leaves), chayote (looks like potatoes cut up, but greenish transparent color, soft) - i think lemon taste in there from either lemongrass or lemon itself #[[fast memo]] ^XjGtepZL0
  * Fruits
    * Persimmon
      * Cristina grew tree in yard. It is fruit that is SO sweet. Basically a natural dessert AND incredibly healthy. Apparently good for inflammation.

      * Tasty af, healthy af
    * PINTO BEANS

  * Nuts
    * Macadamia nuts
      * I think only macadamia nuts are low in oxalates, only ones i can eat
  * Canned Fish
    * Mackeral = very healthy, tasty, and filling. Fishy smell tho.
    * Red Salmon - good, but not as good as Mackeral. I think less fishy smell. Gross looking in can.

  * Canned veggies
    * Beets
      * Very healthy and tasty
  * Food I've Tried / My Body Reaction
    * Indian
      * Palak Paneer - Goop. Smashed spinach, spices, and cheese cubes. It maybe hurt my chest (what ingredient) and gave me a hiccup (maybe over-ate?)
      * Baigan Bhartha - Whole eggplant baked in the tandoor mashed and seasoned with herbs and spices. Good AF.
      * Chicken Sag - rice, pieces of tender chicken, mixed in with green goop. Tastes amazing
      * Chicken Jalfrazie - spicy, soupy/stew, many small veggies, chicken. This maybe gave me heart burn the following night while trying to sleep which would make sense bc spicy. I had short chest pains that flared up for second and then went away
      * CHICKEN BIRYANI - rice, chicken, veggies
      * Raita - Indian side dish meant to cool mouth after spicy food. It is yogurt and veggies. Taste kinda like mayo yuck.
      * Chicken Korma - basically yellow curry with rice you can add to it and tender chicken. V good. Small amount of veggies. EDIT 2: i chose mild this time and it was quite spicy. Caused cough and mucus/acid in throat. Still worth.
      * Chicken Bahaar - Soupy 4 sure. Spicy-ish, but didn't hurt stomach. Left amazing taste in mouth for several hours after
      * Chicken Vindaloo - orange and soupy. Few pieces of chicken and potatoes. Rice. Pretty good, but not best bc soupy
  * Food that i will keep buying
    * Wild caught cod and salmon from whole foods (can check if at Food Lion too)
    * Canned wild caught mackeral from food lion/walmart/etc
    * Sauerkraut
    * Kimchi
    * Carrots and hummus
    * Cod liver on amazon (only eat once or twice per week, don't overdo)
    * Cheese
    * Quinoa
    * Eggs
    * Bone broth
    * Oysters from Food Lion mixed with Tomato Basil soup. Oysters alone is nasty tho
  * [[Drinks]] that i will keep buying
    * pure cranberry juice
    * orange juice
  * [[Spices]] that i will keep buying
    * turmeric (for tea and spices) - good against fungal infection 
    * Garlic powder - good against fungal infection 
    * [[Oregano]] - good against fungal infection. You can also buy oregano fresh, but it's small amount and lasts in fridge 1-2 weeks. I think i prefer spice version, despite it lessens nutrients/etc
