  * tracking back pain fixes
    * [[2023-10-10]]
      * I was having back pain from very bottom to very top of spine. I did 2 things: 1) lad on stomach on bed with head turned right. Then, switched to head turned left. Right side felt good. Left side kinda hurt. 2) did the Child pose with arms spread in front
      * After doing the above my back felt like 2-3/10 points better then before and it was slightly easier to sit up straight in chair
