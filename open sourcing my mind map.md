      * Since my mindmap is public, this opens me up for more risks. Let's discover those risks:
        * More data on my physical body (lab tests), making me easier to hack once there is BCI
          * i could remove this data, but feel it could be very valuable to be public too
        * Data on how my mind works, making me easier to be mentally hacked for adversarial attacks
        * People can act like me and then they start making money off my data instead of it going to me
          * I think this could be good long-term. Who is the better me? 
          * They may constantly run script to keep up to date with my data. But maybe tools will come out that detects people copying data like that
        * Easy to accidentally open access to data i meant to keep private, like passwords
