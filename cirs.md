    * my questions
      * what causes CIRS?
        * copy-pasted answer: exposure to biotoxins, HLA genetic predisposition, altered innate and adaptive immunity, peripheral hypoperfusion at multiple sites and multiple hypothalamic-pituitary-end organ dysregulations
        * HLA genetic predisposition
          * Approximately 24 % of the USA population have HLA gene types that make them susceptible to biotoxin illness i.e.- they do not have the genetic capability to clear biotoxins. The susceptible population makes up 95 % of the CIRS patients. The remaining 5% of CIRS patients do not have this genetic susceptibility. Approximately 76 % of the population is not susceptible to CIRS.
          * HLA refers to the Human Leukocyte Antigen genes on chromosome 6. HLA’s are found on the surface of nearly every cell in the human body. They provide instructions for making a group of related proteins known as the HLA complex which helps the immune system distinguish between the body’s own proteins and proteins made by foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This gene encodes for proteins that present foreign antigens to immune cells for removal. The HLA DR test determines ones susceptibility to CIRS plus many other diseases.
            * These HLA DR/DQ encoded proteins are found on antigen presenting cells such as macrophages, B cells and dendritic cells and they present foreign cells from outside the cell to naive T lymphocytes. The T lymphocytes eliminate the antigen and transfer to B lymphocytes the ability to identify the antigen for removal. The structures of the HLA DR molecules are critical to the initial peptide/antigen recognition. The alleles most important for chronic illness expression include DRB1, DQ, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5.
            * Just as we inherit one red blood cell type from our parent, we also inherit white cell types from our parents. However, the proteins inherited are not just one or two as in red cell proteins; they are many more combinations of proteins into groups resulting in over 50 different HLA types. The chart on page will demonstrate which haplotypes are associated with which biotoxin illness susceptibility.

        * at a smal level
          * Biotoxins show the structural forms of amphipathic ionophores, creating ion channels that disrupt cell electrodynamics and hence the battery-like charge, rendering the cell incapable of performing its energy producing functions derived from the ion pumps. They also behave as “rogue” ion channels.
            * my interpretation: biotoxins can literally create rogue ion channels, which can then allow in and out of the cell stuff that shouldnt be going in and out, which disrupts energy producing fx of cell. This is a feature of amphipathic ionophores. Cell-signaling is disrupted inside the cell by the disruption in the ion movement.
    * my questions about this URL
      * what binding?: "This binding releases specific amounts of inflammatory molecules, cytokines, complement and TGF beta-1- the innate immune system activation sequence. This inflammation is not specific and cannot remove the biotoxins but result in persistent inflammation and a syndrome now known as CIRS."
    * 2 major subdivisions of immune system: the innate or nonspecific and the adaptive or specific immune system (found only in vertebrates). We are born with innate immune responses intact; we develop adaptive immune systems after birth.
      * general
        * The innate immune system is the body’s primary defense mechanism against invading antigens: the adaptive immune system is summonsed by the innate immune system as a second line of defense provided there are no HLA genetic defects in the individual (74% of the population).
        * 26 % (1 in 4) of the population has an aberrant HLA system that leads to upregulation of the innate immune system with an inability to adequately notify and summons the adaptive immune system.
        * This defective setup informs the basic underlying issue with CIRS; an aberrant upregulation of the innate immune system due to biotoxin inducing triggers, with a defective adaptive immune response to these inflammatory signals
      * Innate System
        * Acts almost immediately to infection, the adaptive takes longer to respond
        * Is not specific to a particular antigen and reacts the same way to a variety of infectious agents and inflammagens.
        * Recognizes toxins with pattern recognition receptors
        * Does not provide long-lasting immunity to the host
        * Communicates with the adaptive immune system via macrophages/monocytes and dendritic cells as antigen-presenting cells, the first responders of the innate immune system
        * Recruits immune cells to the site of infection via the use of cytokines and TGF beta-1
        * Activates the complement cascade system to assist in removing antigens
        * Presents toxins to the adaptive immune system naïve lymphocytes called T cells, the lead cells of the adaptive immune system. These inflammatory molecules do not have a specific target and they do not remove biotoxins. Trichothecenes, the biotoxins released from Stachybotrys and Fusarium mold species can slow the maturation rate of dendritic cells, resulting in defective antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system
        * Both aspects of the immune system have cellular and humoral components.
      * Adaptive System
        * Provides long term immunity by creating immunological memory after the initial exposure to a specific pathogen or biotoxin
        * Adaptive immunity involves the destruction of foreign pathogens and presentation of their peptide remains to T cells to begin process of antibody production by B cells, and NK cells and cytotoxic T cells.
        * The T cells teach the B cells to recognize and respond to invading toxins so that, in the future, if re-exposed, antibodies produced by the B cells can mount an appropriate antibody response  
        * In biotoxin illness, due to specific genetic HLA susceptibilities, the adaptive system cannot see the biotoxins presented to them by the innate system and thus cannot produce antibodies to neutralize them. The toxin isn’t recognized as foreign. These toxins have a unique structure called “ionophores” that prevent them being metabolized or excreted. The innate immune system continues to create inflammatory cytokines, leading to dysregulation of multiple systems and thus the CIRS diagnosis 
        * Patients with CIRS have dysfunction of T reg cells which are converted into pathogenic T lymphocytes via the inflammatory cytokine TGF beta-1
        * B cells, the cells of TH 2 immunity, tend to fight infections and inflammagens outside of the cell and produce antibodies
        * T cells, the cells of TH 1 immunity, tend to fight infections and inflammagens within the cell and produce transfer factors. Transfer factors are made in a similar fashion to B cells antibodies
    * biotoxins
      * extremely small, fat soluble molecules capable of going from cell to cell through membranes without being carried directly in the blood stream rendering them impossible to find in the blood stream
      * Biotoxins bind to certain surface receptors, particularly those on white blood cells (macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells) called antigen presenting cells.
      * these biotoxins reside intracellularly in the fatty acid membrane, not accessible in the blood stream. They are difficult to dislodge particularly when the adaptive immune system is not adequately working.
      * how biotoxins do what they do to harm u
        * Biotoxins have both water and fat-soluble capacities. Biotoxins nestle on the inner fat-soluble membrane of cells, thus showing a predilection for fatty tissue like the brain, nervous tissue and the autonomic nervous system. Thus, they disrupt cell function without destroying the cell; as opposed to pore-forming toxins which create large holes in cell membranes, which are enough to kill the cell itself.
        * Cell-signaling is disrupted inside the cell by the disruption in the ion movement
          * The cell then triggers a defensive response by activating genes that code for inflammatory cytokines, on top of the already overworked innate immune system driven by CIRS. Elevated TGF beta-1 is a sign that the body is over revving from both an innate and an adaptive immune system T cell response.

      * Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
        * a primitive part of the immune system. They are PROTEINS expressed by cells of the innate immune system to identify two classes of molecules: pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are associated with microbial pathogens, and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which are associated with cell components that are released during cell damage or death.
      * pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
        * microbe-specific molecules that are recognized by a given PRR

    * random notes
      * difference in toxin issues vs viral/bacterial issues
        * Unlike bacterial or viral pathogens, which can be identified in blood work, biotoxins cannot be identified by routine blood tests and therefore one needs to rely on identifying them via the damage they inflict on the immune system, neuropeptide hormones and end-organ hormone systems.
