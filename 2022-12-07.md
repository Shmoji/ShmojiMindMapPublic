    * Feel good bit better today than past 2 days. This makes me think feeling bad (body sore all over and burning all over) those days was either due to 1) the run or 2) the CBG. Or could be i feel better today bc i took THC extract for first time in while
    * Got results back for blood taken from Regenesis on Dec 2 2022. Only bad thing was Candida Antibodies IgM being Equivocal instead of negative. This means questionable and need to take blood test again in 2 weeks to check again. Gonna right more about this in other note for IgM
