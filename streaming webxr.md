  * how TOs
    * how to stream webXR to twitch with all audio and errthing
      * only way i found to work:
        * start streaming with SideQuest app...it captures headset view and all audio
        * use webcam mic or buy mic that clips to shirt. Dis only way
          * this was one way to get VR headset mic, but it was on same track as game audio and very quiet: open oculus.com/cast and turn audio on there. this captures your quest mic...thaz only need for it
