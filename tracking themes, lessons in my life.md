      * some point during this break i had an insight into what following your heart and doing you is - it's being in the moment - but that's not the best way to think about it. ill have to think on how to word it
      * it's also about analyzing what is most alive for you

      * during this break from work i realized i value intimacy in most aspects of life. i dont wanna read 2 books at once - just one book. i want to work towards one creative thing at a time, not many
      * my heart is pulling me towards finding this kind of intimacy with a community - which is SO hard in this day and age
    * [[2024-09-10]]
      * been feeling depressive - i think bc capitalism is using me like a puppet again as i am forced to search for opportunities again and this directly takes time away from being creative. And then on another area - i have a million paths for being creative and i know i need to commit to one, but i cant choose. So 2 depressive causers
      * i noticed during depressive periods, things feel much more romantic which is interesting (but only certain things trigger this - like art, nature, etc)

      * i noticed a way of living where you let tension and pain move through you (so it can stay), but you just focus on what is bringing you life. This keeps popping up time after time last few weeks. EX: been trying to use it in convos: historically ive always felt all kinds of bad feels in convos pressuring me to provide certain facial expressions and feelings back - so trying to figure out how to not focus so much on those bad feels
      * it really is a kind of mental move. could be wrong, but i think it's just a quickly executed mental move, not one that needs to be maintained over time using energy
      * the thing above is also somehow related to that meme saw about "i just gotta" loop being about looking for safety and you dont just gotta do anything. this scales to all sensations and mental actions
      * noticed if i can literally breathe into the alive thing/the thing outside of "i gotta", but still allow the tension/"i gotta" - then this is OP

      * for years and years ive always wanted to create a market of definitions - where anyone can privately or publicly define all the symbols they know (then you can compare with other people and clear up confusion - plus good for education)

but recently i realized that i wouldnt even really wanna do this (without proper incentives)

now what i do indeed want to do (by natural incentives NOW): i want to define meme-like symbols for the sake of recalling later

so i want to store meme-like symbols that very likely only make sense to me - for the sake of ME being able to recall that info again at a later time (whereas if i dont store that symbol, there's less chance i will remember it later - which is why there is a natural incentive)
      * the above made me realize that best way to communicate is to find intersection of UR memes with other ppl's memes (which prob gets more general the larger the group ur communicating with is or if dont know what to talk about)
      * when im recording things down for spaced repetition, i need to experiment with really listing out all my memes
    * [[2024-09-24]]
      * theme i realllly wanna keep after this life arc at home (despite knowing it will be v hard to keep if something else takes my focus): study sessions learning a thing i really wanna learn like i did during at home arc
      * other related themes i wanna keep: not overloading myself and being okay with one thing per day - breathing into the moment

      * when people interact with you, are they interacting with a discrete version of you or a continuous version of you?
      * i noticed i almost always assume people interact with a discrete version of myself. Either a tensed-up me or some negative version of me. Or some finite version that i dont necessarily wanna be even if it is "good"
      * i think realizing and remembering this theme could be quite useful
    * [[2024-10-19]]
      * MOLDY BRUSH YO: if inflammation in mouth and throat strong or getting weird burning/scratchy feeling, maybe get new toothbrush - it could be mold on brush. Think this may be what smell/burning in nostrils at Papas was - and maybe it happened so quickly to that toothbrush bc how moist it is in that house from door??
  * lessons i wanna persist over time
