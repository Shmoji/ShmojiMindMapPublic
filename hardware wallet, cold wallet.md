  * questions
    * what is a recovery seed on hardware wallet?
      * me: basically the master password even if hardware dies. If hacker gets it, you screwed. I mean you can try to send funds away before they do tho
      * Definition: A recovery seed, also known as a seed phrase or backup seed phrase, is a series of words generated by your hardware wallet when you first set it up. This sequence of words represents the private key for your cryptocurrency holdings in a readable and memorable format.
      * Purpose: The primary purpose of the recovery seed is to allow you to recover your cryptocurrency funds if your hardware wallet is lost, damaged, or stolen. By entering the seed phrase into a new hardware wallet or a compatible software wallet, you can regain access to your coins.
    * what are the secondary passwords for hardware wallet?
      * PIN: protects your HW from unwanted PHYSICAL access. It's important to remember that the PIN is unique to your device and does not transfer to other Trezor devices or any other type of wallet. If you were to use another Trezor device, you would need to set up a new PIN for that specific device.
      * so if someone gets both your device and your pin, you basically hacked. BUT, this is slightly better than them having recovery seed bc there's still hope: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/hardware wallet, cold wallet#^cEoIgFAMD|what do if someone gets your device and PIN?]]
      * However, if someone gets your device and PIN, they still cant get your recovery seed unless you stored somewhere stupid
    * what do if someone gets your device and PIN? ^cEoIgFAMD
      * Immediate Action: If your device is stolen and you suspect that the thief knows your PIN, the best course of action is to immediately use another wallet application where you can enter your recovery seed and transfer your assets to a new, secure wallet. This way, even if the thief can access your hardware wallet, your assets would no longer be there.
    * on trezors, whats the difference in a hidden wallet and standard wallet?
      * me: standard wallet has no extra security of an extra passphrase and it's not hidden. Hidden wallet requires extra passphrase.
      * me: this passphrase is not device specific, it can be used across devices if one is broken - unlike the PIN. However, this means if you lose this passphrase, you lose all assets in that hidden wallet
      * standard wallet Use Case: Ideal for regular transactions and storing cryptocurrencies that you might need frequent access to.
      * hidden wallet Use Case: Ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrencies or for assets you don't need regular access to. It's also useful as a security measure against physical threats, as it provides plausible deniability â€“ if you're forced to open your wallet, you can open the Standard Wallet without revealing the existence of the Hidden Wallet.
      * Seed Extension: In the case of Trezor and other similar hardware wallets, the passphrase acts as an extension of the seed. The standard wallet is derived from the seed (a series of words generated during the setup of the device). When you add a passphrase, it effectively creates a new seed by combining your original seed with the passphrase. This leads to the generation of a completely different set of addresses and accounts (i.e., the Hidden Wallet).
