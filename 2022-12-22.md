    * Was previously doing good past days. Sinus pain and face pain was like 6/10 today. Even tho i took iodized salt

    * Around 2pm kidney stone randomly got aggravated. I drank some mag chloride. Pain didn't instantly go away, but it did hour or so later. Not sure if thanks to MagChloride or random.
