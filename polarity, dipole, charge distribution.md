  * what is polarity, dipole moment, charge distribution
    * tracking learning what is polarity, dipole moment of atoms/molecules
      * [[2024-09-03]] first try at learning electric polarity, dipole moment, dipole, perm vs induced, net charge vs polarized #memo
        * polarity and dipole moments tell about internal charge distribution and not about net charge (will explain more later)
        * UNDERSTANDING NEUTRAL CHARGE: for atom/molecule, the protons are all packed in the center - and they have a center point. and the electrons around atom/molecule, their center is same center as group of protons, UNLESS polarized (e.g., due to an external electric field or the presence of neighboring charges). This implies that:
          * **No Net Dipole Moment:** The atom does not exhibit a dipole moment, meaning there is no separation/distance between the positive and negative charges within the atom (they share same center)
          * **Symmetry:** The atom is symmetric in terms of its charge distribution of electrons around the nucleus.
          * **Electroneutrality:** The atom's overall charge is neutral, and the forces due to the positive and negative charges cancel out perfectly at the center, leading to no net polarization of the atom.
          * me: so we are talking about centers of DENSITY
        * UNDERSTANDING POLARIZED: force of some other charge causes the center of negative charge to move relative to the center of its own nucleus' positive charge (sort of stretching the atom/molecule towards attractor). i think this same concept scales to any charged object (so not just defined by middle of protons)
          * GPT: A broader term that refers to the distribution and orientation of charges in a system, which can lead to a dipole moment. Polarization is the cause, and the dipole moment is the quantitative result of that polarization.
          * EDIT: polarization not always caused by something external - as you'll see with permanent dipole below. Polarization and dipoles always talking about a system and its internals - and these internals can be CAUSED by something external (induced) or something internal (permanent)
        * DIPOLE MOMENT: Refers specifically to the measurement of the separation of charges WITHIN a molecule or system.
          * not directly related to time; it is a spatial property
          * **Physical Meaning:**
            * A nonzero dipole moment indicates that there is a separation of charges, meaning the molecule or atom is polarized.
            * A higher dipole moment means a greater degree of polarization, with a larger separation of charge (between pos nucleus center and neg electron cloud center) or stronger charges involved.
        * PERMANENT VS INDUCED DIPOLES
          * ELECTRIC DIPOLE: when 2 equal and opposite charges are separated by small distance (but scales up to more than just 2 charges) - (again i think of this separation in terms of neg electron cloud center relative to pos nucleus center)
          * me: when thinking of proton with 1 electron, makes sense to think of distance away - but in more realistic scenarios, youre really thinking about center of density of positive nucleus vs center of density of negative electrons (can be some small distance shifts still tho, but often iz just big pile of electrons in one/more spot around nucleus)
          * PERMANENT DIPOLE: materials that exhibit being dipole naturally - like water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia (for various reasons based on internal structure - not gonna memo this for now)
          * INDUCED DIPOLE: only exhibit dipoles once efield is applied (or other ways)
        * Q: is dipole and dipole moment the same?
          * No. **Dipole** is the CONCEPT of having two opposite charges WITHIN SAME SYSTEM separated by some distance (in terms of density centers as talked about). **Dipole Moment** is the measure of the strength and orientation of that dipole. (a vector bb)
        * Q: are permanent dipoles NOT net electrically neutral then?
          * They can be either or. Typically they are electrically neutral. Dipole just tells about the separation and magnitude of the internal charges but does not indicate an excess of charge overall. It is a measure of the charge distribution within the molecule.
          * NOTE: polarized molecule can be thought of as: 1) having different density centers as discussed OR 2) having multiple areas of concentration of pos and neg ions internal (like water)
          * GPT:
            * (Zwitterion) is molecule that is net neutral charge, permanent dipole, and has FULL charges (like ions) instead of partial charges due to bonds (like water has) - apparently most polar molecules are due to partial charges. This diff of full charges internally vs partial charges internally is key (dont get stuck on dis, iz confusing as hell, may memo separate one day)
        * SCALE: important to realize dipole moments scale from 2 charges to TONS of charges with a system - then at scale you're thinking in terms of OVERALL/NET neg charge vs pos charge centers. Believe this is how you would think of dielectric since it can be larger material
        * Q: do all electron shells when not polarized, have same density center as the nucleus
          * yes. 
          * However, when an atom is part of a molecule, or if external forces (such as electric fields) act on the atom, the electron distribution can become distorted. In such cases, the electron cloud may shift, resulting in polarization, where the center of the electron distribution no longer coincides perfectly with the nucleus.
        * Q: so if polarized, is the electron no longer in that shell
          * Polarization does not cause electrons to leave their shells; rather, it changes the electron cloud’s shape or density within the shell.
          * In a non-polarized state, the electron cloud is symmetric, but when polarized (due to external fields or in a chemical bond), the electron cloud shifts, with more electron density being drawn toward one side of the atom or bond spatially. However, the electron still occupies the same energy level (or shell) associated with that particular atom; it’s just that the electron distribution is no longer uniform.
          * so some electrons could be further from nucleus, but also it could just be more electrons on that side of nucleus. imagine circle shell with more electrons at one point. But even if further from nucleus, it still stays in its shell
          * learnt: the dipole moment distance moved away from nucleus is teeeeny, which is why polarization doesnt cause electrons to shift shells
