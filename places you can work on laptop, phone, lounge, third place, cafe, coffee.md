      * Hatto Coffee (very close to or even in Sendagaya)
        * [[2025-04-15]] came today and could basically work as long as i wanted. There's outlets everywhere. Really vibey place. Spacious. I found spot where i could see whole place and lots of outside too, so i was happy. The coffee and smoothies are kinda pricey tho...but not bad compared to American prices tho
    * Excelsior Cafe
      * general

          * their coffee isnt tooooo expensive. But enough where i either choose coffee or the shrimp dish
      * by Sendagaya Station
        * [[2025-04-14]] this one felt kinda cramped, but maybe i just got bad spot
      * Shinjuku beside Sakara House office
        * [[2025-04-14]] this one is amazing. The 2nd floor has amazing view

        * [[2025-04-14]]
          * quite cramped. BUT the 2nd floor has very good view. kinda worth it sometimes
      * near Nakanoshinbashi or Shinnakano
        * [[2025-05-04]] somewhat small space, but i dig it for by myself. The smaller coffee is small, but the bigger one is quite big. They seem to prefer this place as a quiet cafe according to signs
  * Tully's
    * in general
      * [[2025-05-05]] they have a spinach bread filled with cheese and something else...it's delicious and not TOO expensive. They also have lil energy bars and there's a date one that seems healthy tbh. #Food
    * in #nishishinjuku
      * 1) there may be several...this one is by nishishinjuku station entrance and under a shop of some sort
        * [[2025-05-05]] i think this could be #[[good for groups of more than 2]] tbh. Only one issue: they had the type of lighting that hurts my eyes and gives headaches. Once i left, my eyes were all blurry-vision.
      * 2) one right by that park and river
        * [[2025-05-05]] maybe not best for groups more than 2, BUT aside from that one of my favs
