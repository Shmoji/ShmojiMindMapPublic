    * [[2024-11-02]] how primary hyperparathyroidism can contribute to calcium oxalate kidney stone formation, dissociated vs free ions #memo
      * **Excess Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Production**: In primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the parathyroid glands overproduce parathyroid hormone. PTH regulates calcium levels in the body, and its overproduction leads to elevated blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia)
      * **Increased Bone Resorption**: High PTH levels stimulate specialized cells called osteoclasts (do separate memo eventually), which break down bone tissue, releasing calcium and phosphate into the bloodstream. This bone breakdown raises calcium levels even further. (a 2nd mechanism)
      * **Hypercalcemia and Hypercalciuria**: The excess calcium in the blood due to both PTH action on bone and increased absorption in the intestines leads to an overload of calcium in the kidneys. The kidneys attempt to excrete the surplus calcium, resulting in hypercalciuria (high calcium levels in the urine)
      * **Formation of Calcium Oxalate Crystals**: With high calcium levels in the urine, calcium readily combines with oxalate to form calcium oxalate crystals. Oxalate is a common compound found in many foods AND produced by the liver (didnt know this woah). The combination of calcium and oxalate can precipitate as crystals, especially in the concentrated environment of the kidney tubules
        * SOLUTION: a homogeneous mixture where one substance (the solute) is dissolved in another substance (the solvent). **Homogeneous**: This means that the composition is uniform throughout. You cannot see the individual particles of the solute once it's dissolved. EX: saltwater. so same definition i learned for homo mixture (once you have mixture, iz no longer completely chemical - iz physical combo) - but specific type tied to solubility and is HOMO/uniform
        * PRECIPITATE: substances coming/deposited out of a previously stable "solution"/mixture due to sOmE change (water vapor in air to substance of rain/snow/hail, ions in liquid to substance/compound of solid calcium oxalate), one is a chemical process in a liquid, and the other is a physical process in the air
          * calcium (positive) and oxalate (negative) are MOSTLY ions. the oppositely charged ions attract each other, leading to the precipitation of solid calcium oxalate from the solution when their CONCENTRATION exceeds the solubility limit. concentrations can vary based on diet, hydration levels, and metabolic activity.
          * CHEMICAL process: In chemistry (like in your kidney example), *precipitation* refers to a solid forming within a liquid solution because the solid’s components reach a concentration where they can't stay dissolved. This forms particles or crystals, like calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys, which are essentially tiny solid structures within a liquid environment (solo ions no longer free/dissociated)
          * PHYSICAL process: In meteorology, precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) happens when water vapor/gas in the air condenses into liquid or solid droplets and falls to the ground due to gravity. air is a mixture...but not really a solution (maybe metaphorically) bc no solute or solvent
          * Q: is calcium and oxalate on their own in urine considered dissolved?
            * yes. calcium and oxalate ions in urine are typically dissolved when they are in their ionic form, meaning they exist as free ions (Ca²⁺ and C₂O₄²⁻) dispersed in the aqueous environment of urine. In this dissolved state, they do not form a solid and remain evenly distributed in the liquid.
            * For these ions to precipitate and form calcium oxalate crystals, they must reach a concentration where they exceed their solubility limit under the specific conditions in the urine. When factors like high concentration, pH changes, or temperature shifts occur, calcium and oxalate ions can combine to form solid calcium oxalate, resulting in a precipitate. Under normal conditions and concentrations, however, calcium and oxalate are indeed dissolved in the urine.
          * Q: where do these ions get dissolved into urine?
            * The transition from "not dissolved" to "dissolved" for calcium and oxalate ions in urine typically occurs in the digestive tract and bloodstream before reaching the kidneys. Here’s how this process generally unfolds:
            * **Ingestion and Digestion**:
              * **Calcium** and **oxalate** start out as solid compounds or are bound in complexes within the food we eat.
              * During digestion, stomach acids and enzymes help break down these food sources, releasing calcium and oxalate as they convert into soluble (high ability to be dissolved), dissociated ions in the acidic environment of the stomach (not yet dissolved, but in form where they CAN be)
            * **Absorption in the Intestines**:
              * INIT DISSOLVED STATUS WHEN GO FROM INTESTINE TO BLOODSTREAM: in the intestines, calcium and oxalate ions, now in ready-to-be-dissolved-form, are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the bloodstream. Here, they enter a dissolved state, as they are fully dissociated into Ca²⁺ and C₂O₄²⁻ ions, respectively - dissolved in blood stream
              * FREE vs DISSOCIATED: Once in, they are free ions. *free ions* and *dissociated ions* generally refer to the same concept, but dissociated is ions that have been separated from compound (like food you ate in tummy due to acids/enzymes). *Free ions* describes ions that are no longer bound to others and are freely dispersed in solution, highlighting their independent state.
              * In aqueous solutions, these terms are often used interchangeably because once ions are dissociated, they typically become free ions moving within the solvent.
              * in non-aqueous solution like in gastric fluids, ions can indeed be *dissociated* but not entirely *free*, as they may interact with other components in the complex stomach environment. It’s in true aqueous environments that they typically exist as free, independently moving ions.
              * aqueous solution: when we refer to ions or substances in an *aqueous solution*, we’re emphasizing that they are dissolved in water, which allows for properties like dissociation, free movement, and reactivity that differ from their behavior in non-aqueous environments (such as oils, alcohols, or complex gastric fluids). ions be more free in aqueous solution
              * ABSORPTION DEPENDS ON DIFF FACTORS: This absorption depends on factors like the presence of dietary factors (e.g., vitamin D for calcium) and the pH of the intestines, which can influence how well each ion dissolves and is absorbed.
              * Q: what happens if they dont get dissolved or absorbed?
                * many things. 1) come out in poo 2) bind with other substance...then poo 3) obv can lead to deficiencies causing other health issues
            * **Transport in the Bloodstream**:
              * DISSOLVED STATUS TYPES: Once in the bloodstream, calcium and oxalate remain dissolved in plasma. Calcium is carried both as free Ca²⁺ ions and bound to proteins (like albumin), while oxalate remains dissolved in its ionic form (C₂O₄²⁻).
              * The blood serves as a medium that keeps these ions dissolved while transporting them throughout the body, including to the kidneys for filtration (but free ions go alllll over body)
            * got learnt: ahh okay, so calcium and oxalate may not get absorbed until small intestine or even colon? A: yes, same for pretty much everything. Seems most absorption in small intestine - some in stomach and colon too tho
          * The solid formed is called the precipitate (solid calcium oxalate crystals..which then combine to be stonesss)
          * **Precipitant**: calcium ions or oxalate ions or both: In the context of calcium oxalate kidney stones, the *precipitant* would be any chemical that contributes to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals.
          * **Supernate/Supernatant**: After the calcium oxalate has precipitated out of solution, the remaining liquid is the *supernatant* or *supernate*. In the body, this would be the portion of the urine that is free of precipitated calcium oxalate crystals (thank god lol...SUPER)
      * **Reduced Citrate Excretion**: High PTH levels can also reduce citrate levels in the urine (many reasons, not gonna memo). Citrate is a natural inhibitor of stone formation as it binds calcium in pp and reduces crystal formation. Lower citrate levels increase the risk of stones forming. Get dat lemon juice in yo tea bruh
      * **Dehydration (Sometimes)**: Hypercalcemia can lead to polyuria (increased urine output) and subsequent dehydration, as the kidneys lose more fluid. Dehydration concentrates the urine further, promoting calcium oxalate crystal formation.

  * Ways to deal with pain
    * When in MAX pain and nothing else helps:
      * ibuprofen (advil or motrin) 600mg every 8 hours. This prevents worst pain as i saw when Toradol helped in ER. But it causes bleeding ulcers, so need to take Prilosec 20mg once per day when taking ibuprofen. Take Zofran for puking. Take oxy for moderate pain - honestly prob try it before ibuprofen
    * BEST: hot bath
    * Laying with heat pad on abdomen and pillow under knees

    * Weed
    * Massaging the pain areas in every way possible
      * I found sometimes that pushing hard and deep into muscle can have good affects. But is scary to push too hard.
      * Using nails often has best results for some reason (when not pushing hard)

    * MAYBE: magnesium bath or in tea
  * key science to know
    * DRINK LEMON JUICE DAILY: if you have calcium oxalate kidney stones caused by consistently high calcium levels, consuming citric acid (like lemon juice) is important. citrate is negatively charged and calcium is positive, so they bind. This stops formation/precipitation of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate kidney stones. Also, calcium citrate is 1) more soluble - meaning it stays dissolved as whole in pp solution (unlike CO stones that precipitate out and are not dissolved) and 2) more stable - meaning not likely to dissociate back to calcium
  * Anatomy
    * Ureter is on average 5mm
  * Surgery
    * Stents
      * reason to get stent
        * Swelling from the spot where the stone used to be sitting, and/or swelling from the procedure itself in the ureter could block urine from flowing down the ureter after the procedure. Effectively, this would feel just like a kidney stone does (because that side is blocked with trapped urine). So it could make the first few days more painful. Rarely it could be so painful a stent has to be placed while things settle down. So the way we think about it, NOT leaving a stent often feels like rolling the dice- I don’t know if the person’s gonna get away with it (unless they were pre-stented which is a different ballgame). So by erring on the side of placing stents, while I know they are uncomfortable, I also know the kidney and patient are going to be safe. That’s a window into how we think about stents after ureteroscopy.
    * Ureteroscopy
      * what it is: they stick telescope through bladder and ureter and take out stones (often after breaking them smaller with laser).
      * The telescope itself may cause swelling which can cause the big issues of kidney failure. This is why they recommend stent.
    * Laser (lithotripsy)
      * what to do if
        * They do this and do no stent and then my ureter swells shut.
          * Call number on card Dr Rueben gave me: 919-350-ROCK
  * Natural methods to PASS stones (may not be trustworthy, but i saw potential during research)
    * Chanca Piedra (Phyllanthus niruri)
      * Actual scientific experiments
        * In one study of 56 people with kidney stones who took 1 cup of hot water infused with an herbal sachet containing 4.5 grams of chanca piedra twice daily, researchers found that the kidney stones decreased in size and number in about two-thirds of participants https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29617079/
      * Literally known as "stone breaker"
    * Apple Cider Vinegar
