  * tracking thoughts on passive farming
    * [[2024-01-06]]
      * so in about a year i made around $500 by passive staking around $15000. important to remember the rewards can be claimed anytime, but the staked amount cannot.
      * deciding to stake or not is hard. Once you stake, you can touch dat money. What if price goes wayyy up - i prob still would want to sell tbh. But what if crisis happens? i may want to sell then to get food or whatever is needed to survive

      * today i staked 8570 OCEAN which is $10000 rn. It unlocks on 3/9/2028 - 4 years from now lol. fire. Bc i did 4 years, the lock multiplier is 100% - i just know that means i make more money somehow lol
      * the site says ill get 14,509 OCEAN over 4 years for "rewards - fees" - but is that fixed? thought that came from fees of people using protocol which is not fixed
      * it also says passive APY is 52% (when 4Y is selected)
      * so i still am using this crap and dont even know how it works lol
        * at end of locking period, do you always get same amount of OCEAN you staked back? or do they just snatch some of it if you dont do 4 year lock period?
        * so, the rewards you get while staked are fixed or no?
        * so is the passive APY you get - is that separate from the rewards?
      * i wish i could see how much i made in certain time periods and where it came from. that would help alotttt, but dont see that
  * ARCHIVED: Experimenting with data farming
    * First ever experiment
      * Today i locked half of my OCEAN tokens for one month. 30000 tokens. About $10000 rn. Was first time using hardware wallet through MM. Tokens indeed no longer in cold wallet and are locked.
      * After locking, i staked all veOCEAN on https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0a32ea954a09f006b93ed86f466f3e089567ce8874e0afef5b0ea2d66bae1e99

      * What i want to know
        * How much do i make in 1 month in passive rewards?
          * After locking 30000 OCEAN for 1 month (about $10000 at the time), i made 1 OCEAN in 1 week.
          * In 1 month, i made about 3 OCEAN.
        * How much do i make in 1 month in active rewards?
    * try 2
      * after last experiment lock date ended, you have to withdraw all tokens in order to lock again (i guess updating veOCEAN lock just locks any newly earned ocean)
      * Note: i never claimed rewards from last lock of 3 OCEAN
      * I did a withdraw and then i relocked 30000 OCEAN again. i locked for 2 years. Can find date on site. Start out with 15049.920 veOCEAN and that will decrease over time.
      * idk why the heck i documented here and didnt timestamp. Gonna continue this in journal entries
