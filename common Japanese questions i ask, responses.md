        * clear and polite
          * あなたが言ったことを英語に訳してもらえますか?
            * 言った is the past tense of "言う" , meaning "to say." So, "言った" means "said." meme: 言う...peeeyew! stank out the mouth was said. formal is pee out the mouth bc...言います...peeeemasu lol. 言った...eat tha words you said to realize what u said
            * こと (koto) is a noun that can mean "thing" or "fact." When used after a verb like "言った," it turns the verb into a noun phrase, meaning "the thing that was said." (nomnomilizer)
            * 訳して (yakushite) comes from "訳す" (yakusu), meaning "to translate." The "て" form is used here to connect it with "もらえますか" . meme: wen someone translates something 4 me, i say: ya coo
            * もらえますか  comes from "もらえる", which means "to be able to receive." So, "もらえますか" is politely asking if it's possible to receive the action being mentioned, in this case, the action of translating. meme: can u fix my damn infected molar
        * casual and simple
          * 英語でお願い?
            * all kana: えいごでおねがい
            * translates to: in English, please?
            * this is casual. if professional, use お願いします or other above
      * That sentence was too hard #japmemo ^IGv8s6c6l
        * その文は難しすぎました
        * got learnt: leaving out particle は is more natural in daily convo specifically for expressing subjective experience. for objectively describing (or writing professionally or in letter) leave the は
        * breaking down
          * 文 = ぶん = sentence
          * 難しい (むずかしい) means "difficult" (notice い was dropped just bc thaz grammar) meme: Tatum's cat yuzu that passed...thaz hard
          * すぎる means "too much" or "excessively." meme: sogayyy - often excessively or too much when dis said
      * i have no idea what you just said
        * FORMAL:「今の言ったことが全く分かりませんでした」(Ima no itta koto ga mattaku wakarimasen deshita)
          * "全く" (mattaku) means "completely," "totally," or "entirely."
        * Or more casually:「今の全然分からなかった」(Ima no zenzen wakaranakatta)
      * Can you break what you said down into pieces and then repeat it after?
        * 言ったことを分解してから、それを繰り返してもらえますか？" (Itta koto wo bunkai shite kara, sore wo kurikaeshite moraemasu ka?)
        * breaking down
          *  "言ったこと" (Itta koto) means "what you said.""を" (wo) is an object marker."分解して" (bunkai shite) means "break down into pieces.""から" (kara) means "after" or "since.""それを" (sore wo) means "it.""繰り返して" (kurikaeshite) means "repeat.""もらえますか？" (moraemasu ka?) is a polite way to ask "can I receive the favor of...?" or simply "could you...?"
      * Can you break down <Japanese> into pieces?:
        * 「を分解して説明してもらえますか？」
        * For your specific example with "どう言いますか?" (dou iimasu ka?), it would be:「どう言いますか?を分解して説明してもらえますか？」This translates to "Can you break down 'どう言いますか?' and explain it?"
        * breaking down
          * 分解して (bunkai shite) - break down (分解: bunkai - to decompose, して: shite - and/then, form of する suru - to do)
          * 説明して (setsumei shite) - explain (説明: setsumei - explanation, して: shite - and/then, form of する suru - to do)
          * もらえますか? (moraemasu ka?) - Can you do it for me? (もらえる: moraeru - can receive, ます: masu - polite ending, か: ka - question marker)

      * How to say <english phrase> in Japanese? - you can use the following structure: #japmemo ^llNyPPHpl
        * を日本語でどう言いますか？" 
        * For example, if you want to ask how to say "I'm happy" in Japanese, you would say: "I'm happyを日本語でどう言いますか？"
        * breaking down
          * どう is how
          * いいます is polite version of いう to say
          * why を instead of は: uses を after <english phrase> bc iz not the main topic of sentence; it is direct object of the verb いいます
          * why で instead of に: に indicates direction, location, or target which is not this. Instead, we use で, which marks the means or METHOD by which something is done—in this case, the language used for saying something.
          * i forgot the どう...dont forget the doooe
      * what is <japanese word> #japmemo
        * <japanese word> は何ですか
        * Q: in "は何ですか" is it always nan instead of nani even in formal contexts? A: yes. nani would be weirddd
    * common responses i give in general
      * tanoshimidesu - im excited or looking forward to it
