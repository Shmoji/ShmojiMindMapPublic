  * what is it?
    * physical property of material that measures its ability to conduct heat. Indicates how easily heat can pass through a material
    * me: often this process is dictated based on relationships between objects, not just one object. Also the default environment temperature
  * questions
    * so if thermal conductivity is easy, then heat can easily pass through material. Does this mean the material heats up quick or its hard to heat it up?
      * GPT4: it doesn't directly tell you how quickly the material itself will reach a certain temperature. The specific heat capacity and thermal mass give you a better idea of how quickly the material itself will change temperature.
      * me: I thought GPTs answer contractdicted what John Carmack had tweet about: "I have a bar of titanium and a bar of silver in the refrigerator to give Trista a visceral demonstration of how thermal conductivity changes the perception of temperature" - but GPT then further explained:
        * GPT4: 
          * The tweet you mentioned actually aligns with the principles of thermal conductivity and how it affects the perception of temperature, rather than contradicting them. Let me explain how.
          * When you touch a bar of titanium and a bar of silver that have both been in a refrigerator, they are at the same temperature as the inside of the refrigerator. However, silver has a much higher thermal conductivity than titanium. This means that when you touch the silver bar, it will conduct heat away from your skin more efficiently than the titanium bar. As a result, the silver bar feels colder to the touch, even though both bars are actually at the same temperature.
          * This phenomenon is due to the rate at which heat is transferred from your skin to the object you're touching. A material with a high thermal conductivity (like silver) will transfer heat away from your skin more quickly, leading to a stronger sensation of cold. Conversely, a material with lower thermal conductivity (like titanium) will not draw heat away from your skin as quickly, making it feel less cold by comparison.
    * what are the best thermal conductors?
      * casual Elon: Carbon in diamond form beats everything. Even just mashing carbon diamond dust into copper gives huge boost to thermal conductivity
        * he also said silver is best, but not sure why he said thing about carbon right after saying that.
