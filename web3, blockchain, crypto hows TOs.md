  * questions
    * to use a smart contract on the blockchain, do you need internet connection?
      * Yes. GPT4:
        * Interacting with a smart contract requires an internet connection because smart contracts operate on blockchain networks, which are decentralized systems spread across many computers around the world. To deploy, execute, or interact with a smart contract, your instructions need to be communicated to the network. This is done through transactions that are broadcast over the internet to nodes in the blockchain network. These nodes validate and execute the transactions, which may involve running the smart contract's code, updating the blockchain's state, or both. Without an internet connection, you wouldn't be able to send these transactions to the network or receive updates about the contract's state or the results of your transactions
    * thinking very very longterm, what is the benefit of blockchains. versus using a decentralized network that is not a blockchain?
