      * i was having lot of success relieving tension by doing thing that is hard to explain where you aim towards good sensations or release or outside tensions, then can visualize using finger to twist and twirl all tensions into the target. seems this is same as putting all sensations you feel from whole body into one sensation without actually moving those body parts. being aware of awareness helps this process too ^iHiB1ShJb
      * the above relieved pain but ultimately was too much bandwidth focusing on that process. what worked was just be dead fish. just be a body. you may keep indulging in mind, but then stop it bc you not being ded fish

      * was not able to sleep. but then i switched to on-back, put pillow under my knees, and another pillow in my arms and i went to sleep pretty soon after ^xGH5jRQfw

      * remebered old method and helped me get to sleep and reduce pain last night: each inbreath and outbreath BOTH go to infinity instead of hitting a limit. Sometimes uncontrollably they will be constrained by sensations, but over time both flow to infinity (which feels like no pain, feels good)
      * another key point: you can get limited and increase pain by focusing too much on method, so try to just be a body while doing the above - and then those 2 together are OP
