  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * could be random, but interesting observation: i was having all kinds of pains last night. In kidneys, in back, in sinuses. I kept waking up and it was hard to sleep again due to pain. But then i woke up from nightmare feeling ton of fear. I was shaking. I processed that once i was consciously awake - and my pain seemed gone
    * Today average pain has been around 2-3/10 which is lowest in about 3 months prob. Guesses why: 1) something about waking up shaking from that nightmare and processing that 2) i took mag chloride bath in morning 3) the weed last Sunday
