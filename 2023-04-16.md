    * Kidney stone may be in bladder now, but idk. Also, rn both kidneys are hurting despite only one stone. Why? My ideas: 1) maybe that's what happens when stone gets to bladder 2) maybe due to chanca piedra supplement im taking to try and break stone 3) maybe due to Dandelion Root tea im drinking. Overall, not sure
