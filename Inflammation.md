  * What is it?
    * I define it as a process and you can notice signals of this process. Sometimes these signals can be labeled as inflammation.
    * Inflammation is the normal tissue reaction following an injury from a traumatic agent or growth of organisms.
    * Inflammation can result from a variety of factors, such as environmental chemicals, injuries, scrapes, insect stings, or splinters, as well as radiation and pathogens including bacteria, fungi, or viruses.
    * Inflammation is beneficial as the body’s defense protocol, but it if lasts too long in healthy tissue it can become damaging. The inflammation process begins immediately with the initial trauma. The arterioles in the surrounding tissues widen, allowing increased blood flow to the area causing the redness. This reaction increases permeability of the arterioles causing the white blood cells, prostaglandins (chemical mediators), and blood proteins and other fluid to build up in the injured location. When this accumulation of fluid swelling happens, it compresses the nerves in the area—causing pain. Prostaglandins produced by the cells may cause irritation of the nerves and cause even more pain.
  * Management methods for the pain of inflammation
    * NSAIDS: Inhibit the cells from producing prostaglandins, a group of hormones that will create the reactions that cause pain
    * Corticosteroids: Inhibit prostaglandins formation by the cells and inhibits the function of white blood cells.
    * Antihistamines: Histamine is produced by the white blood cells and causes local inflammation; these medications block the white blood cells from producing and secreting histamines.
    * Hot and cold therapy: Cold constricts the blood vessels, inhibiting inflammation by numbing the pain and cooling the area. Heat reduces inflammation and the build-up of fluid in tissues.
  * Terminology
    * Inflammatory conditions end with the suffix “itis”: periodontitis (bone and tissue), gingivitis (tissue), pulpitis (pulp), mucositis (mucous membranes), tonsilitis (tonsils), and stomatitis (mouth).
