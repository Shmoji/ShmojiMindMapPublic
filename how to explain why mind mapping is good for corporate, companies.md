  * think about how much info is lost in "collaborative documents"
    * when i work on PoC, there's soooo much info i discover about that tech or project. But almost 99% of it is not recorded or looked at.
    * enterprise teams dont realize how much valuable info is lost because they want everything as "collaborative documents" that strip away the INDIVIDUAL. Instead, each person should take their own notes and then combine all these together without destroying the individuality
