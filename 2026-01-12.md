- [[symptom drainage, mucus, throat, nose, sinus]]
	- woke up with no mucus down throat. Ate the family mart chicken and rice small meal and from then on had mucus down throat all day nonstop. Kept swallowing it all day. THEN: i gargled bit of water and did some hawktuah-like maneuver in my throat and felt the mucus swallow, but it felt like i got something extra. The extra thing felt like something dry surrounded the mucus. After that, no more nonstop mucus down throat, it was stopped. Interestinggggg, what's up with that. And does something in that particular meal trigger it? Only thing scary in there looks like the sauce they put on it, whatever it is.
- [[characters, personality, stories idea]]
	- so i vibecoded a Pokemon like dialogue for my resonating hypothetical fictional universe today
	- but i dont think I'd even use or like a ui of just characters like that 
	- BUT if they were in a PLACE, that's different - like me reading all the Pokemon npc dialogues and even recording and posting some
	- NEXT TIME: try putting the character in an actual environment. Can be 3D, 2D, whatever feels right in moment
	- i like this idea bc it's great way to get my resonating ideas out into a better format
	- i do get hint i need to work on writing in the 3rd person xxxx style that most writers write in tho (cant remember total name of it)
