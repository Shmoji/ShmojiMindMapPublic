- [[Food costs times weights]]
	- [[セブンイレブン in Japan, 7eleven]] レギュラー coffee: ¥140 = $0.90
	- [[ファミリーマート family mart]] cabbage, imitation crab: ¥250. This was surprisingly filling and good. Only downside is bit of mayo or ranch at bottom
	- [[ファミリーマート family mart]] Salmon and pickled radish sushi. Tasty, but bland near end and all same. Probably more filling then the salmon and tuna sushi. COST: ¥520
	- the two above together was too much food today, didn't need that much. Total: ¥770
	- [[松屋 (matsuya)]] Grilled mayonnaise salmon bowl. COST: ¥794. Quite filling. Kinda bad aftertaste. Sometimes the raw salmon is kinda gross. Slimyness gives the ick. EDIT: last night my nose got really stuffed and struggled to sleep, will have to see if either of those bc this meal
- [[松屋 (matsuya)]] learned the Okubo matsuya doesn't have the salmon set meal or the chicken bowl. Oh whale. Will keep eye out at the other locations.
