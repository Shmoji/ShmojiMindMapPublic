  * what is it?
    * maybe this algo:
      * input sensory data
      * through reward functions built into human body, learn common patterns that allow coherent structure of reality (something makes me think this requires other humans for long-form thought)
      * in order to solve issues and achieve rewards/goals, the mind forms better and better representations of reality
      * thoughts are these representations from the POV of the observer
    * based on above algo, i think thought is always a process, so it's always over x amount of time
