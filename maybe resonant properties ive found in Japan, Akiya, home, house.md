      * [[2025-02-25]]
        * message to Ken Corp trying to get help viewing props ive already found online
          * Hello, I am an American visiting Japan in 2 weeks from time of this message. I will be there for 2 months. My main goal is to look at properties.
          * I have already found several properties online I am interested in looking at.
          * I have fairly precise criteria for what I'm looking for that is different than most people. So, if you see properties that you think align with me, then I'm very open to look at other properties too.
          * Here's my criteria:
          * 1) Everything needed is a short walk away. Food, groceries, stores. Can walk to everything needed.
          * 2) In a hub. Either in a downtown/lively area or just outside of one. For example: a plaza, right by the main train station of city, a town center or hub.
          * 3) Prefer no needed renovation.
          * 4) High safety in terms of natural disasters.
          * 5) I need to know rules of the property. I'm open to leasehold.
          * I mention rules because have a mission to use the place I buy as a "Third Place" of sorts. My home that is also a home to the public. Hopefully help with the loneliness crisis.
          * I've mainly got my eyes on Tokyo and Nagano right now, but im open to other places that fit to the criteria.
          * For price range, my max is probably $30k.
          * And im open to weird properties if they fit this criteria - like business buildings or abandoned temples.
          * Here are the properties I'm currently interested in:
          * 1) my favorite: https://toushi-athome.jp/ei_41/dtl_6984299520/?DOWN=1&BKLISTID=001MPC&SEARCHDIV=1
          * 2) https://myhome.nifty.com/chuko-ikkodate/nagano/uedashi_ct/detail_144d6cb223673d6aa9b6c0b5ce830b33/?clientIds=athomef
          * 3) https://toushi-athome.jp/ei_41/dtl_6984359006/?DOWN=1&BKLISTID=001MPC&SEARCHDIV=1
          * 4) https://toushi-athome.jp/ei_41/dtl_6980384359/?DOWN=1&BKLISTID=001MPC&SEARCHDIV=1
          * 5) https://toushi-athome.jp/ei_41/dtl_6978659757/?DOWN=1&BKLISTID=001MPC&SEARCHDIV=1
          * So, how can you help me? By:
          * 1) finding properties you think resonate with my criteria and mission
          * 2) helping me get in contact with properties I am already interested in so I can figure out if one is a good fit or not
        * then, i sent same message to Nippon Tradings International due to them having somewhat of focus in Nagano, i think they have office there, and being English friendly
      * [[2025-03-09]]
        * chatted with Nippon tradings buying agent
        * notes
          * dont recommend leasehold. You gain no investment over time since dont own land. Fees.
          * each municipality is different for renting license. short term stay license
          * 1000 bucks per prop to inspect it
          * 2-4k USD (per year?) to start company for company to pay mortgage on prop you bought
          * does prop even allow monthly rentals - many dont allow you to do dat
          * 20-30 million yen for sharehouse in Tokyo. 200kUSD
          * TODO: look into sharehouses in Nagano
          * think 10mil yen (70-80kUSD)
          * realtors do the research to find your listings and return prices
          * TODO: double check if he was right about all this and especially about being able to pay monthly on prop you bought
          * TODO: how can i quickly explain whyspia to people aside from just "iim building a community lol"

    * tracking how Akiya Mart Direct works
      * [[2025-03-02]]
        * BA cost to travel and look at properties: $30/hour for BA to travel - prob plan for whole day num of hours (lineup multiple properties for them) - assuming i need them to travel for me
        * Erik exp with Akiya maintenance costs: $700/year in maintenance for him
        * what AMD does first: pair you with agents. call with agent. then 4000USD for AMD to agent basically.
        * steps 1-5 from powerpoint: takes up to 1 month. rest of steps is like 2 months
        * insurance on property is optional. think his was like 500USD (per month?) maybe
        * closing cost and commision cost will always be there: about $4400
        * there is some AMD-proxied service for utilities and some specific tax bill AMD offers through someone else
        * there's someone that helps with visas - proxied through AMD
        * they (AMD) basically help with errthing - even cars
        * why did he quietly say not to give any listings to the buying agent? A: i have no clue
        * BE EARLY: you want to give a week before viewing a property
        * TransferWise for money transfer. TODO: set this up ahead of time
        * they dont use escrow. buying agent holds it. or can just go and use your money in person
        * my thoughts after the fact
          * so AkiyaMart is basically consulting agency with all kinds of services hooked on to it. Ken Corp is basically real estate brokerage with all kinds of services hooked on - but less than AM. Then you have local real estate agent/agencies which offer less service, but cheaper and closer to local. So basically goes from tallest middleman to lowest middleman...and of course the more middleman it is...the more it costs
          * seems i may be better finding local buying agents myself bc will save LOTTT of money. once back home from trip, if AkiyaMart still feels necessary, ill do that
          * what if none of props ive researched so far work out?
            * then i have to research more to find more (this takes lot of time)
            * AkiyaMart would maybe help here
            * Regular buying agent could maybe help here
          * COMMISSION FEES are only paid if there is SUCCESSFUL buy of property
          * PAY NOTHING with Ken Corp: apparently they offer everything i want to do for free - even if it doesnt work out. I only get charged if i buy - which i want to buy bruh
