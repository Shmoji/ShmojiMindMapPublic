	- today i decided to move all anki decks back into just one deck thanks to recommendation from Zen/Matt
	- there's some decks i literally just stopped studying bc i knew the category. Thaz pointless. instead need to be brave to delete cards when needed or just keep studying
	- i like the idea of just being able to blast study whatever comes up
	- HOWEVER, maybe even a bigger issue: i need to make sure every card is TINY TINY TINY. Currently not the case. i need to edit current stuff to make tiny and probably split into much smaller cards
	- i noticed today i just dont enjoy spending soooo much time reviewing cards. i could be doing art or something more alive. i think making cards tiny helps with this....but ALSO, i decided i wont study except when i realllllly have free time and nothing else to do. Like when chilling or whatever
	- we'll see how it goes from here...
