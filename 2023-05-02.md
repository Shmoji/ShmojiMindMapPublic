  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Today is 4th (i think) day of taking RestorFlora and AminoReplete. Woke up this morn with heavy feeling kidneys. (such shit timing bc starting protocol below today)
    * At lunch, started Nystatin and UltraNutrient
    * After lunch, my kidneys felt even heavier
    * By dinner, my kidneys felt heavier and sore. Also took Nystatin at dinner and Mycopul 2 hours later. Can find schedule in health experimenting
    * What causes these kidney pains. Since i felt this in morning, does that mean caused by RestorFlora, AminoReplete, Kashi cereal, or Magnesium since been taking for few days? 
    * Yesterday i felt much chronic fatigue and sinus issues. I couldn't do anything after work cuz of it. Was bedridden and brain fogged. Maybe after an episode like that it affects my kidneys
    * Apparently too much of diuretic stuff can hurt kidneys. So maybe lemon juice, ginger tea (had last night), or dandelion tea can cause kidney issues
    * Just realized: both kidneys hurt - not one. What does that mean in terms of the cause?
