  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * A consistent thing: i woke up at 2am to hearing and feeling my pulse right at jaw spot near ears. When i woke up again later was not hearing it. Possible triggers: 1) some issue im unaware of 2) the leg workout 3) chili 4) jaw clenching
    * Another consistent thing: poop that first comes out is hard and spikey and darker colored. Not black, but slightly darker brown. This is compared to later half of the poop which is lighter brown, softer, and not spikey
    * Yesterday was one of the most pain free days in forever. Today had pain/swelling in jaw/throat about 3/10. Possible causes up above in first bullet. Also, had skin burning today. Got about 4/10 bothersome for about 2 hours.
