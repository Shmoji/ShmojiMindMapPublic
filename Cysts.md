      * Buildup of trapped keratin usually causes epidermoid cysts. Keratin is a protein that occurs naturally in skin cells. Cysts develop when the protein is trapped below the skin because of disruption to the skin or to a hair follicle.
      * These cysts may develop for a number of reasons, but trauma to the skin is typically thought to be the main cause. When numerous, an underlying genetic disorder such as Gardner syndrome may be the cause.
    * They’re filled with cheesy-like, white keratin debris
