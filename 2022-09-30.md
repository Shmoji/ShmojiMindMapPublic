  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * 2am i was awoken with night sweats and all kinds of weird sensations almost feeling like cold symptoms, but hard to say. Racing heart, knot in throat, pain symmetrical in jaw, ringing ears, sinus crackling more than usual, teeth kinda numb, pain in legs, spasms in legs and arms, pressure mid to upper stomach. 
    * 9am now and definitely not sick, so wtf was last night 
    * All day throat feels like trying to close and hurts 6/10. Jaw hurts same.
    * Took 1.25/4 THC around 1:30pm and it helped with pain a lil. More than CBD. Barely even felt psychoactive effect too

    * Jaw and throat pain came back after THC wore off. 
    * At 10:15pm i took Claritin D
  * Game video script try 1
    * I've recognized something about gamers.
    * I could be way off in saying this, but it seems like the majority of people don't really seem to appreciate the simple experience of video games
    * People love the complicated puzzles. They love the super advanced graphics or maybe the retro graphics. They love the statistics.
    * But all this stuff seems like very superficial judgements.
    * What about the experience?
    * *Klonoa captivated by some scene, maybe Kingdom of Sorrow* Look how beautiful this background is. I feel like i could sit and stare at it for a while. Seeing this as I play gives me feelings of awe. Feelings of beauty. Appreciation for creativity. Motivation to be creative myself.
    * I'm not playing these games to judge them based on some statistic. I'm here for the experience. 
    * What does it feel like to solve a puzzle? 
    * What does it feel like to do a difficult platforming section?
    * What does it feel like to get lost in the music of the game?
    * Personally, I feel like getting stuck in a judgmental mode can ruin the experience of the game for you. 
    * I've heard friends say stuff like "oh, that game was okay. It could have used more challenging puzzles" "it should have removed this weapon"
    * While, I think input like this is important for improvement, I think it can also ruin the experience for you as a person trying to feel something by playing a game
    * **scene**
    * Person 1: "Ahhh, this is so beautiful. I love how they put so much detail into it, yet the missing details add to it just as much"
    * Person 2: "ooo their textures are such doo doo butt stain. This other game is so much better at optimizing the space of their maps. Shaaa!"
    * Obviously every person has different reasons for playing video games, but I encourage you to be more experimental. Try  to experience the game as it is. 
    * Instead of trying to label the game, try to notice what it feels like to play it.
    * Personally, I struggled with this a little bit at one point. As a streamer, I thought I needed to examine each game intellectually. I thought I needed to feel extreme excitement the entire time I played a game. But I realized that was me placing expectations on the game. Expectations that ruined the experience for me. 
    * I did this for multiple reasons. 1) I thought if my expectations about the games came true, then it would be bliss 2) I thought these expectations coming true would look the coolest to a viewer watching a stream.
    * However, that wasn't the case. Setting expectations all the time mainly just made things less authentic.
    * Once I stopped with expectations and simply experienced games, I began feeling all kinds of different emotions. 
    * You always hear people talk about living in the moment. Well, that is basically the nerdy geek version of that. Experiencing games to the fullest by living in the moment.
