  * what is it?
    * bile acid sequestrants
      * what dat?
        * gpt answer:
          * also known as bile acid-binding resins, are a class of medications used to treat certain conditions related to lipid metabolism and cholesterol management. These drugs work by binding to bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract, preventing them from being reabsorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, the liver needs to synthesize new bile acids, which requires the utilization of cholesterol from the blood, effectively reducing the overall cholesterol levels in the body.
          * Bile acids are naturally produced by the liver to aid in the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. After their role in digestion, they are reabsorbed in the intestine and recycled back to the liver in what is known as the enterohepatic circulation. Bile acid sequestrants disrupt this recycling process by binding to the bile acids in the intestine, forming complexes that are excreted in the feces, thus breaking the enterohepatic circulation cycle.
          * Due to their cholesterol-lowering effect, bile acid sequestrants are commonly prescribed to manage high cholesterol levels and improve lipid profiles.
    * a toxin binder known to be best for CIRS
  * what it do?
    * my answer:
      * it binds biotoxins and sends them out in ur poopy
    * some website: CSM has a positively charged nitrogen side chain built into a polystyrene chain. This long molecule is not absorbed so that when it is swallowed there will be a location of binding action beyond the stomach, in the duodenum and jejunum where CSM will bind to bile acids and biotoxins. CSM has been used for years to bind hydrocarbons such as DDT and DDE as well as PCBs but also will bind unusual compounds such as the M protein of Arava, a rheumatoid arthritis drug, as well as dioxin. CSM is organic glue! Once glued, down the tubes!
      * you can ask GPT to explain this like ur 10 if confused
  * compared to [[welchol]]
    * Many people will want the better efficacy of CSM, which does have 25% more binding sites compared to Welchol.
  * issues to be aware of with CSM
    * dental issues
      * anecdotes from discord
        * CSM sticks to the teeth and can cause them to break down. I was not aware of this initially and ended up needing a root canal/crown from a filling that cracked wide open and another filling after being on CSM for years on and off. I worked in dental for a decade and have immaculate oral hygiene btw.
        * It was making my gum disease angry, so I started drinking it with a straw and now it's not so bad.
      * solutions
        * some folks use metal straws (or any straw i think) too which seems to help
