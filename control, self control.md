    * Dr K: conflict monitoring is self control
      * as we supress our internal awareness (especially of conflicts), we lose capacity for self control
        * the more emotions you suppress, the worse your self control will get
    * Dr K: self control doesnt exist
      * why?
    * Dr K: awareness proceeds control
      * if you get mouth numbed at dentist - you then cant feel mouth and cant control it
        * Then Dr K corrects himself and says awareness IS control
      * me: BEING proceeds awareness
    * Dr K: self control is like mana. It is depleted over time. Not a character trait. 
      * the more self control you exert, the more it depletes. Ex: you hold back yelling at dumb boss all day, then when you get home you cant bring self to eat salad - pizza it is.
      * 2 things that drain self control
        * 1: emotional regulation
        * 2: stress
          * stress is externalizing our attention to solve the problems that cause stress. When you externalize your attention, you stop paying attention to your internal conflict. 
            * me: the self is external. This is why i struggle often bc i get confused about whether self is external or internal. It is external. I need to BE and have awareness of the TRUE self - which is something you BE rather than something youre aware of in the typical sensory way.
      * what boosts self control: meditation
      * researchers used EEG to measure brain. They found the anterior cingulate cortex (responsible for monitoring internal conflict)
        * They found when we stop monitoring internal conflict, our capacity for self control goes out the window. So, self control isnt a real thing, it's our capacity to monitor internal conflict

  * how to think about control
    * https://youtube.com/shorts/7z-OAmqE_Vw?feature=share
    * think about what you offer. not what people will think or will think or how you'll look
    * Dr K doesnt know if he can answer questions. May even give wrong answers. But he can just offer what he has.
    * all you control is what you offer
