  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * i must have slept good because i woke up with all symptoms doing muchhh better. Like only 2/10 pain today which is rare. Only reasons i can think of from yesterday that improved my health: 1) i got like 5 minutes of sun in morning and like 20 minutes of sun at sunset. I've had days where i got morning sun and then didnt feel better. But i remember that time at Southpoint i stood in sunset talking to Storm and felt great next day. 2) I took bit of tincture THC last night. So little it didnt affect me mentally. Have maybe seen this pattern in past. Not just instant pain relief from THC, but noticeable long-term into next day. But is it actually the THC or just random or from something else like sunset? 3) i licked hand with bit of Iodized Salt in it. Will need to keep experimenting and do that again when feeling bad and see result the next day
