	- ate the matsuya beef bowl for first time in a while and it was so good. That night had no issues, but i awoke with pain and inflammation pretty darn bad. Especially in throat. 5-6/10 pain. Beef seems to do that to me, but will keep documenting to see. It could also be due to the soy sauce which has wheat in it
	- also woke up to good bit of mucus going down throat all day like 3-4/10 mucus
