    * brainstorming
        * [[2024-05-02]] first ideas on Japan trip 2025, prefectures, regions, islands, what iz Komoro and it for all dese #[[fast memo]]
          * Natalie - could ask if can live there
          * AKIYA COLLECTIVE: stay here in Komoro (city) of **Nagano** Prefecture (Chubu region, Honshu island)
            * 47 Prefectures in all of Japan. They are basically like US States - even in government sense. Main diff is that there is less power in prefectures and more centralized in national gov - unlike US states
            * 9 regions in all of Japan - which the prefectures are organized into (regions arent gov entities tho, just for geography/mapping/culture). Hokkaido, Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku, Kyushu, Okinawa
            * 5 MAIN islands (but made of thousands of islands): Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu. Okinawa (all have same name as regions i see)
            * Honshu is biggest island in Japan - covering basically all of top and middle, some of lower but not all - for the main middle island.
          * see if I can hang with Michael of Montana
          * memo notes

        * [[2025-01-01]] searching for home and community
          * maybe i can literally search for/explore/visit 1) a physical home 2) a physical community 3) communities in general
          * for physical homes im looking for 1) something i vibe with in appearance and location and safety 2) would be very preferable if it is part of a community that is walkable, but not a must i guess
          * people interested in building a ?home generator?
    * tracking learnings on visas
      * [[2024-05-02]]

        * tbh this visa sounds hardddd, but cool to know about i guess

          * Intra- means within or inside a single entity or group (e.g., intracellular = within a cell). meme: intrails are inside
          * Inter- means between or among multiple entities or groups (e.g., intercellular = between cells). meme: enter one enter two enter 3...many diff entities
