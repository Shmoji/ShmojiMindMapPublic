  * rating on how useful this is for me right now: 1/10
  * confidence i understand this: 2/10
  * what is it?
    * wikipedia: probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of variables and their conditional dependencies via a DAG
    * some website: mathematical model for representing causal relationships among random variables by using conditional probabilities (wow that sounds like word spaghetti)
  * what it do or what is used for?
    * good for taking an (event that occurred) and predicting the likelihood that any one of several possible known causes was the contributing factor. For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.
