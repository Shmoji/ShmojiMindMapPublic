    - well, i was going to try and get referrals to both Rheumatologist and Infectious Disease...but there just isnt enough time since im leaving for France in few weeks
    - Dr Chris would have been able to get me referrals. I wanted to see Dr Kamitsuka of ID in Wilmy bc he works with medicaid and seems good. Originally i wanted to do Dr Perfect in Durham but that referral expired.
    - Dr Chris gave me 1 week of Sporanox 100mg...which ive heard is not enough to fix mold issues...but if i get a herx reaction, then that is likely a sign of colonization from it working - so i will have learned something
