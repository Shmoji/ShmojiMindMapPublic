  * tracking experiences of it
    * [[2024-06-17]]
      * at VC, i realized i can almost always push through exhaustion and it often is worth it
      * i noticed my main way to recover from exhaustion was to be alone or to lay down and nap or almost nap or to sit somewhere and just do not much
      * main time where i was V exhausted and literally regained energy was when i went and sat down at dance party specifically just to listen to music and decompress - and everyone invisible rope dragged me onto dance floor. Slowly over time my energy regenerated and thrived - but defs not instant
      * i found it interesting how even when dead tired i could still talk about the deepest of things and have novel things to say - i was doing this at like 3am in the tea house
