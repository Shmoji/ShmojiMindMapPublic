This is because of awesome experiment L mentioned where judger sits in discomfort of not knowing for 2 hours while playful part gets to gain confidence in guiding and playing for 2 hours at park - but playful or whichever part gives some knowing by giving an intention of time, place, thing beforehand]]
    * use Suno to engage with energy/spirit of conflict or thing you want or YOU
    * find way to let things emerge naturally
    * talk to someone about it
      * what if i want to resolve the internal conflict without talking?
        * maybe get over that desire?
    * consider my [[Mentors]]
  * further questions
    * Are you stuck on a narrow task?
      * take thing you're stuck on. Break down small tasks of it based on what you WANT. For example, i wanted to learn algovera api, but was stuck and didnt want to. Then, i broke it down into pieces to do and it became easy to be unstuck
