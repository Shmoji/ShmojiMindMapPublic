    * Going to drink tea with honey in it. Currently it is 1pm. I am not having many symptoms, except minor 2/10 pain under jaw floor and under jaw area under ear. Also nose i mostly clear. I read that honey can upset candida. Maybe that has delayed affect in my body. Sugar feeds candida -> hours later it increases sinus infection -> this somehow affects jaw -> i nose rinse and that relieves it somewhat
    * By about 5pm, my jaw floor/throat pain were about 4/10 and burning increased a tiny bit. Too small to say anything really caused the increases.
