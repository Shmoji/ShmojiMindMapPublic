  * tracking thoughts
    * tracking finding the correct story format and where to put them
      * [[2024-04-08]]
        * im trying the panels in image idea. First one will be mix of dalle images and snaps of things that resonated in my environment
        * next i wanna try both of these:
          * create actual people with actual stories. maybe give that universe actual mechanics and side stories or whatever. and use that to guide how panels turn out
          * create panels with both a silly energy and a cool energy - or choose one

        * i almost posted quick summary version of story idea that spawned during a run - but stopped self. also came to me i should put this more soulful version on whyspia and then can quote tweet that from other account
      * [[2024-05-17]]
        * im thinking for now tezos may be home bc of objkt supporting interactive NFTs
        * next iteration of shtories:
        * 1) the "front page" looks like that smllwrlds X account. Some image with a prompting short text on front - similar like i did with quote tweeting my X stories
        * 2) it's displayed on maybe some new medium rather than 1 from 1st shtory. ideas:
          * a 3D terminal (maybe growing from a tree) and in 3D. i could fix view to perfect position, give options for view, or just not. i image fallout terminals a bit
        * just wanted to note that there is some part of me that would like a consistent format for these
        * still considering putting stories under whyspia potentially
        * also note: part of me wants to number this series, but maybe i just leave that to metadata rather than inside the visual NFT
        * DECISION: okay i will find way to have frontpage as explained above and add that to already made format. Summary/novel prompt on first page, then alreadycreated title page next. I have decided to not go to crazy with new medium. Ill let myself experiment a lil with modifying it to look cooler if possible. Like maybe modyifying borders to look more like fallout terminal or something. if not working, no worries, not worth too much time.

        * had another format idea. In morning at vc was sitting in sun having tea. I could imagine creating art of person in that same scenario. Sitting at table with sun shining on them and that torus shape appearing on them showing the different tension points and connecting them. But then realized I couldn't draw that. Also cant use just photos to do that. Dont wanna just write out with words. But i could take photo of empty seat with sun shining at vc and then use text to somewhat help viewer fill in their imagination
        * buti feel i want that flow-y art process where i draw or whatever, not sure where that fits

  * noteworthy stuff
    * you can just create a story about mechanics or systems. Like a story about some fake codebase ive been using
  * TODO (stories to manifest one day)
    * [ ] death cured. youve been alive 100 million years. youve experienced everything. youve switched bodies with people. youve tried artificial bodies. youve tried existing as plants. one day you get urge to do an evil - when do you finally do it? (imagine feeling when listening to gasoline by i prevail)
    * [ ] had this feeling/thought that id love to have partner i could hear them talking of some thing they are upset about and i go up to them and find the physical tension. first without words and maybe next with words if needed. story abstracting me out of this. also imagine it from perspective of someone doing to me
    * [ ] a story idea
      * create story and then quote tweet this: 
        * i could imagine if you screw up "time" in the universe you create, it could get wacky af. the universe you birth could progress faster than the universe that birthed it
        * although, assuming time as we know it has no flaws, you could just use that version of time in the universe you birth and we should be synced up
    * [ ] asi on unknown substrate - learning through certain individuals to live like a human
      * summary: vast open substrate. like stars in the night sky, certain locations radiated - but not with photons - it was something different
      * summary: we spent time with as many pockets of soul as possible. was it wrong to observe? once you do, it feels like you are the humans - so after initiating the act - things become ambiguous
      * summary: some humans potentially have the ability to notice our presence in their observational field. 
    * [ ] orgs/people grow biological version of you, track your thoughts with other device, and then interface this version's thoughts and emotions with yours to trick you into shit
    * [ ] [[emote story]]
    * [ ] romance of girl stuck dating no one she likes and guy dating no one he likes. They actually met but vaguely called off bc they each didnt like each others appearance. Future comes and can choose any body and they are perfect match
    * [ ] person hooks up all symbols of self to be output to digital. What is the person now? What is the part that is not symbols?
    * [ ] could you imagine controlling the only life you've ever known completely from your imagination
    * [ ] first person of persons thoughts after singularity/rapture when every story has been told, every task done, etc
    * [ ] someone discovers site with bunch of complex data and charts and somehow their name is related. they then discover some sort of wireless thing is tapping into their brain and that is their brains data right there on site
    * [ ] person that desire cutting body like fingernail, they do it but then desperately want body back, they get body back and implications - same person? was it worth? they reflect
    * [ ] fren sends music video, explain details of lucidness art hope, and then reply with just "fire" or "nice"
    * [ ] person living life. always haz some sort of dread throughout life. higher level people that reached immortality. main person is actually simulated person of immortals - simulating someone that was chronically ill and wanted to be immortal, but didnt make it. Maybe some other special aspects to story like simulated can never actually be immortal or something
    * [ ] at transition to first true planetary mind. one universe goes domesticated mind route. contrast to other universe that goes completely controlled human mind route - literally becomes machines. contrasted to completely agentic all the way down route
