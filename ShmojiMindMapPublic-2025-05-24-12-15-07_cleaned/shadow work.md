  * techniques for processing shadow
    * 1: Say or question self with very cliche/direct statements, but dont consider the validity. Let the unobserved side of you respond. For example: why do you not love yourself? Dont consider validity
    * 2: BE the YOU that is there to protect <your name>. Then have external person ask that protector questions like 1) why do you need to protect x 2) when did you start protecting x and why? 
    * Tell the REAL story using the actual words. Dont just use hypotheticals or abstractions or JUST EMOTIONS. Emotions are good, but ALSO tell the real story details. Dr K gave example of someone going to grave of parent that was abusive and yelling cuss words at them.
  * questions to ask for shadow work (write these down - it forces you to analyze your response)
    * why is success not for me?
    * why am i not good enough?
  * how TOs
    * how to find your shadows
      * 1: search for patterns of behavior that FEEL like self sabotage. That is shadow showing up. There is some need that we denied we have that is trying to get fulfilled despite conscious mind thinking we shouldn't or dont want that thing.
      * 2: attracting the same types of unhealthy people or relationships over and over. When we repress something in ourselves, we our quick to notice it in other people and we will either HATE them for that quality or LOVEE them for that quality (or a mix of both).
      * 3: any area where you feel REALLY morally righteous. 
      * 4: triggers. Both trauma triggers and attachment triggers. 
      * 5: in projections we make about other people. People we HATE and want to change. Or people we idealize (like with limerence) - we feel cannot have trait ourselves and have to get trait from someone else.
      * 6: additional way to think about [[projection]]: something that is out of our awareness that we are insecure about - you can notice it because instead of thinking about yourself this way, you obsessively thinking someone else is thinking of you that way
