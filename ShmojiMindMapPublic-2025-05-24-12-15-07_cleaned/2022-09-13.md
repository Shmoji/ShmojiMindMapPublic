    * Saw Allergist at UNC Allergy Eastowne with Dr Sood today. Found out I am allergic to dust mites and grass pollen, but maybe these don't cause my symptoms.
    * Grass pollen becomes issue in summer, so if issues arise only in summer, then probably due to that.
    * Dust mites are year round issue. Things that help are 1) cleaning bedsheets/pillows/blankets often in HOT water. Think she said you can get dust proof bedsheets/etc too, but not sure. 2) Make sure to vacuum often. Use vacuum with hepa filter, whatever that is. 3) do not use humidifiers. Mites live longer in humidity 4) Wipe dust with MOIST towel
    * Dr Sood said definitely inflammation in nose. She noted the turbinates.
    * Dr Sood wants me to do regular saline nasal rinse. Then, after that use azelastine nasal spray (it is antihistamine). 2 sprays each nostril 2 times per day. Can use Flonase too. I probably won't start this until im done with other nasal irrigation stuff. But good to have things to experiment with
