    * tracking learnings during 2024 elections in USA
      * [[2024-09-05]] primary vs general elections, what iz super tuesday and around wen, wen iz elecDay #[[fast memo]]
        * first primary elections happen and then general election happens
          * Primary elections generally take place several months before the general election. Primary is basically about narrowing down to one candidate per party to go on to general election. independents or 3rd party candidates can also go on to generals, but v hard as of 2024. The timing can vary significantly by state:
            * Early primaries: Some states hold their primaries as early as February or March of the election year
            * Super Tuesday: A significant number of states hold their primaries on "Super Tuesday," which typically falls in early March
            * Spring and summer primaries: Many states schedule their primaries between March and August
            * Late primaries: Some states hold their primaries in late summer or early fall (Aug-October)
          * The general election in the United States is held on a single day for all states:
            * Election Day: By law, the general election for federal offices (President, Vice President, and Congress) is held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November of even-numbered years
            * learnt: but there's early voting still, so not just one day lol
        * voters have to choose a party. you can apparently change it anytime...but i bet there's time delays with this maybe and maybe rules sometimes about it
        * often primary elections only allow you to vote in party youre affiliated with. General elections are always open to all to vote for whoever you want despite party affiliation
        * Alternatives for primaries
          * Some states have adopted alternative systems to address party limited concerns:
            * Open Primaries: Allow any registered voter to participate, regardless of party affiliation
            * Semi-Closed Primaries: Permit unaffiliated voters to participate in a party's primary of their choice (only one tho)
            * Top-Two Primaries: All candidates appear on the same ballot, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party - and you can vote no matter your party
