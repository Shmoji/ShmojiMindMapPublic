  * story notes
    * wow! in game show episode, you learn a lot. Game show host is Proxy 1. Proxies seem to be created by humanity that escaped Earth on ship in order to somehow restart humanity on Earth. But then the Awakening happens once proxies are no longer needed and should kill them. And as a plan B, somehow cogito virus should help kill the proxies
    * you learn there are creatures outside domes giving living birth - prob old humans
    * so Vincent is creator of Romdo?? 
    * humans that escaped Earth on ship created proxies. Proxies created human birthing machines to create humans. New humans dont have babies so create AutoReivs. i guess the plan by old humans is to eventually kill off proxies and new humans, but leave AutoReivs to maintain bottomup infrastructure new humans created.
    * apparently Proxy 1 created Ergo Proxy. Also many scenes throughout show are just Ergo being manipulated by Proxy 1. Proxy 1 wanted revenge on the creators
      * Perplexity: Proxy One created Ergo Proxy. Proxy One combined his own Amrita cells with those of Monad Proxy, a female proxy he had fallen in love with, to create Ergo Proxy as a perfect duplicate of himself. Ergo Proxy was given the traumatic memories that tormented Proxy One regarding the true purpose of the proxies' existence. Proxy One created Ergo Proxy as an "Agent of Death" to punish the creators (humans) for the pain and suffering they had caused.
      * Ergo decided he didn't want to carry out his purpose as an "Agent of Death" anymore. He went to Monad in Mosk dome and they made an agreement - Monad would remove Ergo's memories so he could live as a human, in exchange for Ergo staying with her until they perished from the Pulse of Awakening. This is why he is attached to Re-L - she was created from Monad, but is human. He wanted to be human like that and of course Monad was Proxy 1's lover at one point
    * Dedalus creates a new Re-L that actually becomes a full proxy - it is Monad. This Re-L kills self at end. Whereas Re-L and Vincent stay to maybe fight old humans
