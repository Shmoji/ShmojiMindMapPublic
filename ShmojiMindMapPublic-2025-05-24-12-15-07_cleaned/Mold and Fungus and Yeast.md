  * What is mold and fungus and yeast?
    * Mold and fungus are related but distinct concepts. Fungi are a group of organisms that include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. Molds are a type of fungus that grow in the form of multicellular filaments called hyphae.

      * via negativa
        * They are distinct from plants, animals, and bacteria.
      * What they do
        * Fungi play important ecological roles in decomposing organic matter and recycling nutrients in ecosystems, and some species form mutually beneficial associations with plants, such as mycorrhizae.
    * Molds
      * Molds are multicellular fungi that grow as filamentous structures called hyphae, which can spread out over a surface and form visible colonies. Molds reproduce by producing large numbers of spores that are released into the air, where they can be carried to new locations and begin new colonies.
      * Growth
        * molds typically require a moist environment and a source of organic matter to grow, while yeasts can grow in a wider range of conditions and can even survive in dry environments.

          * my summary: Sometimes toxins wont clear naturally
          * copy and paste definition from website
            * Our bodies can only metabolize and remove a certain amount of toxins in our lifetimes.  This means that we can have a significant exposure quickly or smaller exposures over time that will bring us to our body’s removal limit.  Once we reach our limit, we reach our toxic load.  It is similar to a bucket that fills over time.  Once it is filled, the body cannot take on anymore.  Once the toxic load is reached, patients cannot handle any more toxins and become extremely sensitive to any foreign substance.  This makes life near impossible as sensitivities to chemicals, mold, and even electromagnetic fields (‘EMFs”) can cause debilitating symptoms.

            * People can become very sick and sensitive to any place that has common building materials and furnishings made with chemicals like volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, and fire retardants.  Other toxic elements we are exposed to include perfumes, artificial fragrances/”fresheners”, cleaning products, personal hygiene products, cigarette smoke, and the list goes on.
            * Virtually every organ we have has a protective system to filter foreign pollutants, pathogens, and toxins.  Our  mouths, sinuses, and lungs produce mucous to trap foreign substances prior to entering our bodies.  Our skin has protective layers.  Our GI tract houses bacteria, fungi, enzymes, and gastric acid to break down and digest foods we eat.  Altogether, our bodies are effective in removing toxins.  In fact, our bodies must metabolize all toxins and excrete them.  There is no medicinal “magic bullet”.  Thus, in order to detoxify, the body may need some help to optimize excretion.  Help will likely  include diet, nutrients and supplements as well as binders.
    * Yeast
      * Structure
        * Most yeasts are unicellular, but there are some exceptions. For example, some yeasts can form pseudohyphae, which are chains of elongated cells that remain attached to one another. These pseudohyphae can give the yeast colony a filamentous appearance, although the individual cells are still unicellular.
        * There are also some yeasts that can switch between unicellular and multicellular forms depending on environmental conditions. For example, the yeast Candida albicans can form both unicellular yeast cells and multicellular structures called hyphae, which allow the yeast to invade host tissues and cause disease.
      * Notes
        * Yeasts are unicellular fungi that reproduce by budding, which involves the formation of a small outgrowth from the parent cell that eventually separates to form a new cell. Yeasts are typically smaller than molds and do not form visible colonies on surfaces, although they can aggregate to form a visible film or plaque.
      * What they do
        * Yeasts generally do not produce mycotoxins, although some species of yeast can produce other toxic metabolites.
  * Terms
    * Mycotoxins
      * Toxic substances produced by certain species of fungi, including molds, that can grow on food and feed crops, as well as in indoor and outdoor environments. Mycotoxins can cause a variety of adverse health effects in humans and animals, ranging from acute toxicity to chronic diseases such as cancer and neurological disorders. Common mycotoxins include aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, and trichothecenes, among others.

  * Mold testing your HOME or space
    * There are 2 mold tests: ERMI and HERTSMI. ERMI tests for 36 mold species and HERTSMI tests for 5. 
    * How to collect sample?
      * Just wipe some dust in your place. Try to get a lot of dust from different places in home.
