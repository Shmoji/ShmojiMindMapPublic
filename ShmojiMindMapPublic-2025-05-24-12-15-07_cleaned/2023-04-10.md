    * Saw Dr Rubens at WakeMed Urology today
    * Didn't like him. Got that weird feeling like he wanted to do surgery on me. He also didnt listen at all. I was about to tell about Dr Rapaport and he just changed subject in middle of me talking. He really insisted on me getting surgery quick.
    * He wants to do laser with a stent that needs to be taken out weeks later. I just want to do laser. The stent helps make sure everything comes out. Sometimes with stent it still doesn't.
    * My stone is 6-7mm.
    * Silent obstruction can lose kidney
      * another term: obstructive nephropathy
      * if the stone starts obstructing urine coming out of your kidney. If it does, it will cause your kidney to swell and unable to drain urine which will lead to kidney damage/kidney death if left unmitigated for a long time.
        * CT showed for sure my kidney was swollen like crazy when most intense pain
    * Google people that actually lost kidney to stone or got permanent damage
      * i can not find any anecdotes to support this
      * there are random articles claiming it is possible

    * Sepsis if infected - life threatening and can happen anytime with stuck stone
    * He was concerned about scar tissue too
    * Searched on fmrbenefits to find way to get second opinion. This is provided through 3rd party for free called Teladoc Medical Experts (service of Teladoc Health). Called them

    * The skin on my arm is yellow. Im not sure why. I had an IV stuck in that arm around where it's yellow. The needle had trouble go in so nurse had to try 3 different times. So why is the arm yellow? Thinking back, there were very short moments today where arm hurt. Kinda felt like bruise inside.
      * could just be bruise

      * could be hematoma, which can just go away. If issues persist on arm, definitely need to see doctor. Sometimes hematomas need to be drained
