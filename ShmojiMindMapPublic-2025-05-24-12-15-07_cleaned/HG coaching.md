      * nowadays
        * i think just from logical observations. People laugh. I dont laugh. They see i dont laugh and they dont like it and stop laughing. I ruined those good emotions for them.
      * in the past
        * i was told i didnt have emotions from multiple people, including my friend.
    * what do i want out of this HG meetings?
      * i want to not be anxious going into meetings where i dont wanna talk, but i have to
      * i want to get super excited without feeling anxious
    * what made you think you have to change yourself?
      * came from my og question: "how can i not be so focused on my face while in social interactions? Mainly when listening, not talking"
    * What does authenticity mean to me?  
      * what if i could communicate to other ppl im having good time without hurting my face. Example is comedian Steven Wright. Blank face, still funny
      * even if i detect someone wants access to some emotion or thing from me, doesnt have to be in form of facial expression. Can communicate another way more authentic to me
  * Interesting notes

      * i notice same dissonance outside socializing. I will be watching funny YT vid and i feel the emotion of laughter inside, but it doesnt come out. And that bothers me. It feels like it should be coming out. Like it should be smooth, but for some reason something is blocking internal from being aligned with external.
    * The word "expectation" keeps coming to mind. Not sure if my issues stem from external expectations, internal expectations, or neither
    * 18 years of growing up around hostile people. 7 years of non-hostility. Where did that fear and other feelings go?

    * my history
      * Feeling fear
        * Hiding behind dad's leg when lady at store tried talking to me
        * shaking being so scared in class in elementary school when i usually knew the answer to question, but scared to raise hand
        * I feel like there was time when i was younger and got embarrassed while doing presentation, but i have no memories of it. I do however, have good memories of physically shaking and sweating before giving presentation
        * Papa yelling at nana and im terrified
        * Kade yelling at fam and im terrified
