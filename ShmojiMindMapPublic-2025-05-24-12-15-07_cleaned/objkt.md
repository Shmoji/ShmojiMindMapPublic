        * so it seems for standard editions you have to choose number of that NFT you wanna offer public - cant be infinite. Then, you have to mint all yourself. Then you have to list and this is when you choose a price
        * in past i thought of [[open edition NFT]] as infinite number of editions, but it's more complex on objkt it seems. Seems like you HAVE to set a time limit for some reason. And you still have to both mint and list open edition for some reason.
