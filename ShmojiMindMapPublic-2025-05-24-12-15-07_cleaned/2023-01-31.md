  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Last few days have had pretty small intensity pain. It would get moderate in afternoons. and have had slight eye pressure on right top eyebrow area. Today and tomorrow I'm going to eat very terrible (chips and sweets and fast food) and see how that changes my pain.
    * Started day by eating bunch of chips and a little bit of cake papa eats and peanut M&Ms. About 30 minutes later my stomach already felt pukey. Head felt burning skin sensation more than usual. 
  * [[Log of breathwork]]
    * What made breathwork hard in most intense moments was that pain arose in throat and nose. Also noticed strong tension present on right neck, but not left. If l leaned my neck to left i felt the tightness.
    * During chill breathwork part, hardest part is that my back kept hurting me no matter the position with back straight.
