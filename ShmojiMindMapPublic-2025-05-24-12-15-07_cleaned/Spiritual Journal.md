      * Value comes into daily experience when not controlling. When you release control to God
      * That spiritual feeling that feels like a blink. Were you thinking during it? 
      * Is it bad to desire that spiritual connection feeling too much? Not sure, let God decide for you.
      * Everything/nothing takes out the personal connection with God. 

      * It's okay to tell God that you can't handle something and relinquish it to him. 
      * Relinquishing layer after layer. It can be hard to tell when you are controlling, but if you are able to recognize it, then relinquish it.
      * I'm bad at relinquishing anxiety caused by excitement and by nervousness. This is perfect area where i can tell God I can't handle relinquishing it and then relinquish that to him.

      * Weed has my brain seeing all kind of unique patterns. I thought about what love is with help of my own Ego's perspective. When i am talking with someone i love, it feels like I'm talking to myself in a way. It's like i look through their ego. I see the real them. Which is also me, and you, and everything. I imagine a narrow path coming from top of head. it leads to bigger areas that connect all minds. Everyone is observer. Biology hardware. Observer literally is the biology, but there's some disconnect here as the observer. It's like hard to comprehend it because it just FEELS weird to think about as observer

      * I just had a very exciting conversation on Twitter with Peter Wang. I felt I had a good point against his point. But i felt his point was really good too and i admitted that with further questioning to understand. This convo left me feeling shaky like i always get when excited, fearful, or cold. I experimented with many things for making shaky go away because that would be a detriment in podcast that i plan to do. Trying to process it in moment didn't work. Trying to understand feeling didn't work. Giving feeling and everything away to God did temporarily work very quickly. I think noticing all signals and giving them away to God works. But it doesn't seem easy right now. Maybe it takes practice?? Maybe it will become something that doesn't need to be conscious of me. Maybe it already doesn't, but im just convinced that it does at some level of ego.

      * Wouldn't it make sense for God to be the perfect match for you personally when you interact with him? He is something more. Wouldn't that something more match your subjective reality perfectly? So it's not hard to reach God. You don't need to try so hard. He's here. He always is.

      * Was in like 7/10 pain and nose completely stuffed. it wouldn't unstuff. I experimented with different methods and nothing. Then, i imagined becoming one with an Earth mind and this human body is just one beautiful piece of that whole and my nostrils cleared right when i first thought about it. instantly. important shit to note down lmao

      * Went to church for first time in years today. I experienced things that were very physically intense. Felt physically overwhelmed. I think it was triggered after i started talking with someone interesting. After talking, while feeling overwhelmed, i thought about why i felt that way. Many things came up. I thought about a feeling of intruders in my personal experience and something about that clicked. I eventually was no longer overwhelmed and maybe bc i accepted the bad feelings and good feelings associated with: 1) feeling intrusion of my personal experience and 2) feeling like im intruding on others by some action of mine, which may just be having RBF
