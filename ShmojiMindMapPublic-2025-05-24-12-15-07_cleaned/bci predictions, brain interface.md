  * list of predictions
    * all from Trent of Ocean
      * People with the $ who are ready to accept the high risk and high reward will fly to Honduras for medical invasive-BCI tourism. Or they’ll build their own, just as Professor Xavier built Cerebro BCI in [X-Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_%28film_series%29).
      * Military BCI will leak into criminals and the black market, then into mainstream to satiate demand, like in [Strange Days](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114558) and [Cyberpunk: Edgerunners](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12590266).
      * Businesses will sprout up to get “medical BCI” in the hands of anyone who asks, like we saw for [medical marijuana in California](https://www.latimes.com/local/abcarian/la-me-abcarian-cannabis-california-20180420-story.html).
