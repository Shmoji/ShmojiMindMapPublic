  * what is it?
    * wikipedia:
      * a system for transmitting messages from a distance along a WIRE, especially one creating signals by making and breaking an electrical connection
      * Telegraphy is the long-distance transmission of messages where the sender uses symbolic codes, known to the recipient, rather than a physical exchange of an object bearing the message.
  * question
    * how do you make that boundary between what is a physical object versus what is not?
      * me: i guess based on distance and common sense?
    * what changes did telegraph do?
      * one of the first forms of electronic communication, allowing messages to be sent over wires using a series of electrical signals (Morse code). It revolutionized communication by making it possible to send messages across great distances in a matter of minutes or hours, rather than days or weeks.
