  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Last night i could not put my ear onto my pillow without hearing the loudest grossest pulse. This does not happen every night, so something triggers it. Only thing i did differently yesterday is that i went on a run for first time in months bc had a rare good health day - was still hurting on kidneys and sinuses, but obv if i can go run, im doing decent.
    * Sinuses been hurting 7/10. Oddly, i pooped this morn and then sinus pain decreased to 5/10. Popcorn chicken poop, which maybe indicates constipation.
    * Sometime between midday and night, both kidneys started feeling 4/10 heavy. No idea why. They've been like 2/10 last few days.
