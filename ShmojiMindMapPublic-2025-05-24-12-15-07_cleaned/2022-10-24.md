    * Today went to UNC GI Eastowne to see Dr Spacek. She says a lot doesn't sound like GI issues, but blood in stool is never good. So, she put in order for colonoscopy and endoscopy at same time bc you're asleep and might as well do both. I can call 9849745050 to get colonoscopy and endoscopy any time. Dr Spacek's nurse line is 9842154677
