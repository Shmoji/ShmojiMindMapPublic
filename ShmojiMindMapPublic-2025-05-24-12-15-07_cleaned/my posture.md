  * posture issues
    * i think i have anterior pelvic tilt
      * i think so bc my lower tummy sticks out and my lower back arches to compensate
      * i noticed long periods of sitting makes tension and arch in my lower back more intense
      * guy on YT said you can workout glutes and stretch hip flexors to fix. Also workout abs.
      * posterior pelvic tilt seems opposite and makes look like no ass
