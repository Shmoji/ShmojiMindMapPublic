  * journal for Emote project
    * imagine i already had all of the social tech done, then what would i do?
      * [[2024-10-27]]
        * i ask this bc many days i dont wanna do the slog coding for building these systems. i wanna do something beautiful in a different way - more traditionally artistic way. And i intuit if i already had the social tech, this is what i would spend most time doing
        * quickly my mind goes to building places
        * then to building places that align with my aesthetics - emo is first that comes to mind
        * my mind goes to joy of building architecture in Halo 3 forge and nooks and crannies
        * locations in YoWorld came to mind - especially emo ones. Same with Meez
        * thought about doing it in webXR, but tbh i dont think that's performant enough if it's gonna end up being social one day - imagining decentraland
        * thought about 2D or 3D - maybe both but 3D to start bc i just like it
        * Unreal engine seems best option. Just too much weird stuff with Unity and Godot is kinda poo poo still in terms of physics
        * the PLACE interface/version of whyspia. NOTE: places often by default arent convenient. You gotta travel to them. You gotta get past certain limits (security, ID, etc). You gotta be vulnerable.
        * But all my social tech is kinda been about efficiency and solving problems - so what would be the version not about that? intuition: aesthetics, fun, play...but like what am i actually gonna build lol
        * ive had ideas of just starting with art of places in certain aesthetic and going from there instead of coding - that's one idea
        * still like idea of making places out of everything - like even lil science concepts ive been learning
        * maybe good: think of place im making like it's MY place, but it's a community place - like record store in Raleigh. Like tea house at vc. Like gamemode and blackout map in Halo 3. It would draw in people that want to be there
        * it's literally just a place to hangout and thaz it. A hub. But then a part of me reads this and thinks "whats the point then". Reminds me of when i built my old apartment room in Boone in Unity.
        * Maybe i can imagine tons of people use the social tech: parallel, pingppl, TAUs - and then build the PLACES of those. Like when choosing a place in parallel, i could build the one for whyspia. Or could somehow make 3D place version of pingppl - not sure what that looks like tho
        * X post:
          * ive always had 2 creative energies: one that wants to solve problems and one that wants to create stuff for fun, play, aesthetics, mystery, games

solving problems has always been easier so ive mostly gone in that direction. but i wanna bring life to the other creative energy

so ive been imagining a future where me or someone has built all the social technologies ive thought of and solved all those issues. Now what would i build?

but i cant figure out something tangible. it's tough. i wanna figure out the minimal step i can take towards this other creative energy so i can start nurturing it - but always something blocking me
        * maybe it really is just building the whyspia inside of parallel
        * had thought: should i start building as country, store, state, planet? i think i should start as small as possible - maybe just a room - or maybe smaller
        * when building this place i dont want it to be TOO me, so feel i should focus on aesthetics of what whyspia is. But of course i can have my own space within too
        * pondering on building places. the sandbox is basically the game engine. bc i dont wanna build in sandbox like minecraft or decentraland or fortnite. so imagining im just building houses and whatnot. basically worldbuilding like lots of gamedevs do. but is that actually what i wanna do
        * maybe i just wanna make stories and art lol. and games. i mean - there are portals to different worlds in most games i like - SM64, Klonoa
        * maybe i wanna create a place that is a portal room with my aesthetic, that is also for just hanging out. That's similar-ish to parallel idea
        * just do the thing. what is the process of doing the nurturing of this creative energy? what is the thing? dont actually know what i want to build - just know it comes from this creative energy
        * maybe just building artistic spin-off of the real whyspia-tech. Ex: 1) portal room of parallel 2) virtual hug 3) cool aesthetic thing/place that just resonates like frutiger aero thing
        * altho feel like i need some story to go off of lol. start with nothing. then first particle of whyspia. then first x of whyspia and so on. until you get to the first room. but i dont think it needs to mimick real universe. i like nothing -> some dense object representing whyspia (which is accurate to rn lol) -> maybe first door or portal or heart
        * so my next step may be to art up a nothing. and then a dense object for whyspia (this feels like story that could get me started)

        * i like thinking in same way Nicho does tea. Slowly piece by piece i build this. But also it's not meant to be perfect, so it doesnt necessarily have to be slow or perfect. I saw him spilling tea all over lol
        * i like to think of it as a culture. Almost like building a house. Which is why i dont think i wanna separate the different contexts to different websites.
      * [[2024-06-28]]
        * i like to think of emote or whyspia like mr beast does with his projects. they make money and people are huge part of them, but the project is still mr beast
        * i like the thought of making something useful for me and frens and family, then they invite their frens and family, and on and on - so the tech grows naturally if it's useful - and will have a culture basically
      * [[2024-06-30]]
        * thinking of this like my version of a camp - caulicamp, jesscamp, etc
      * [[2024-08-01]]
        * thinking of tech im making for myself AND frens or fam. this is related to longterm version. instead of webapp, it is something i first build for mom in private manner and then go from there - with options to do private and public one day
      * [[2024-08-06]]
        * an everything app. But i like thought of an everything app that is passed down in the family. 
      * [[2024-12-10]]
        * a lot of the contexts that im passionate about (hence end up in whyspia), are all about being EXPLICIT and minimizing social energy of things that often take lots of social energy, so much so they almost always lead to less connection
    * tracking ways i like to think of emote
      * [[2024-08-02]]
        * now im left wondering what is emote?
        * i think it will basically be the decentralized version of whyspia
        * does not have my priority rn tbh
        * i liked old definition of: a framework for thinking and communicating at all scales disguised as a few fun or useful use cases

    * tracking brainstorming on receiverSymbol
      * [[2024-02-17]]
        * i just realized that it will be needed to send symbol to multiple receiverSymbols in one send. Came to me when pondering on AIM status message or discord status message for X. Bc who is that sent to? sent to "all". or maybe "emote_status_service", or maybe more. choosing 1 is kinda lame
        * like if i create page for X users to post a status like a discord status - who is defining the receiverSymbol? i am - the dev. the thing im not defining is the sent symbol - which is the status they type.
        * i dont think this is what i wanna do - but could add some sort of text to symbol to identify it as a status. bc most users are just sending whatever text - they dont wanna write in there that this is a status. But whole point of Emote is that user defines their symbols, so im hesistant to append symbols to their symbols. Feel like the fact that this emote is a "status" is kind of metadata. Which this app doesnt really handle that in anyway right now. i think maybe in future that could be handled by users. if they want to categorize their past emotes as a "Status", then they can do that - im not sure how though. I think this is easy actually. it's just hard to imagine an entire sentence/paragraph that represents a "status" as one symbol. User would go to that symbol and tag it as a "status". This means the symbol itself is not self-referential about the fact that it is a status, that is a mapping. For it to be self referential - it would put that in the symbol itself. Up to user whether to make something self-referential or not - not me
        * however, receiverSymbol can act as good metadata for a dev. For example, i realized users may want to follow/sub to a specific "status" from a specific user. But how would code known that sent symbol is a "status". 2 ways really: 1) i have some system for creating metadata to guess if symbol is a "Status" or 2) i force one of receiverSymbols to be something like EMOTE_STATUS service. Then we know they used that frontend to create a status and then other users can easily follow specific "statuses" from specific people.
        * i could optionally give them a few options for who to send the status to (all/noone, tpot, self, they choose) - i like this
    * tracking my thoughts on storage
      * [[2023-09-25]]
        * Decided i will not worry about storing data in decentralized way until much later if app has success. Then if so, can create some sort of converter to convert web2 data to web3 data
        * Basically will be same for private data. In beginning, everything will be public.
      * [[2023-10-05]]
        * Considering lit protocol account abstraction tech for auth, but need to research up first to see if worth it at this point
        * it's maybe worth it..but idk
      * [[2024-10-21]]
        * IPFS: i just cant vibe with either needing to run a node, but if it goes down im screwed OR use service where i gotta pay whatever money they decide
        * arweave: pay instantly as you store data it seems. BUT then data is stored forever no matter what after that. BUT im poor right now and if randomly got 100s of users - id be screwed financially (NOTE: if just storing ur small web game this iz perfect tho)
        * so...sticking with lame poopoo web2 db then

    * tracking thoughts on general data architecture
      * [[2024-03-05]]
        * i want it to be local first, but i have no idea how you would store all this data (like Emotes) just locally...
        * reconsidering data format everything is stored in general. Like what if all data was stored as vector embeddings? Would then need to do conversion back when needed. But is there a point to do this - like why?  i suppose if it's just user-created symbols with no ids then it's good. Bc then can really compare everyone's symbols. But a vectorized Emote is specific to a sender and receiver, so uncertain if you want that vectorized. Also linking Emotes together may require using ids of the Emotes and that is also user-specific - dont get benefits of similarity between users. Storing data as vector embeddings certainly isnt useful as raw file for users.
        * so im left with questions:
          * how to connect Emotes together? IDs concatted in symbols? mapping symbols?
        * maybe there will be 2 architectures. one is like Obsidian where all symbols stored by user is localfirst files. The other is our system's data using embeddings or cids (ehh idk tho)
          * a user can map Emotes together by turning them into symbols that make sense to them. Which sounds hard. i assume it will be kinda like a memory or story for the title/symbol. Then they can map any IDs or embeddings or whatever to that symbol. Not sure that actually makes sense or not. I imagine someone creates symbol saying, i created my work today <date> and that wraps like 10 Emotes. If each emote is content hashable like cids of ipfs, then just link those cids to the wrapper symbol.
          * i think cids are not dependent on anything...i think, so that's basically decentralized i think. But user does need to rely on URLs to data (cids) at some point - which is just kinda interesting. Oh and i just realized, they would need to rely on our servers if data referenced by the cid is stored in our server. I suppose that could be local too, but wouldnt storing all those Emotes local get heavy over time?
    * tracking thoughts on trying to tie data/symbols/triplets/emotes to their semantic meaning and computation
      * [[2024-05-21]]
        * im noticing this shiz makes the backend development hard AF - bc you have to identify certain DB records by creating a new DB record for identification. Then you tie those together with timestamp (or maybe other ways) - and filtering and getting lists just gets to complex.
        * im wondering if maybe underlying system can be anything it wants - centralized DB or what have you - and emote is just api call that stores everything in triplets for sake of tying data to semantic/meaning and computation/app-logic - but no guarantee the emote data is actually used for anything other than attempt at transparency and understanding
    * tracking my thoughts on user/auth system
      * [[2023-10-07]]
        * Remembered that JWT is set on frontend. For my google auth template it is set on backend. But also the flow for google is different. im not confident about this, but i think google can redirect directly to your backend API - i dont think twitter can do that - so you have to be redirected to your frontend where you then call ANOTHER backend API to finish the auth process and get JWT.
        * Pretty sure for twitter, JWT could be set on backend, but would still need to listen at frontend twitter callbackURL and call completeTwitterLogin api - the reason is bc you need rest of user data. Could prob put in JWET and decode on frontend, but then i think that logic would be called more than current setup - but idk
      * mid 2024
        * totally on frontend with particle can login any social/phone/etc and then this generates priv/pub wallet key pair
        * login using Particle Netty -> generates wallet key pair -> server generates JWT and stores pubKey as that user (maybe they can enter username or something here)
      * [[2024-10-02]]
        * can sign using ETH through particle netty sign sdk. This generates signature that can be used with my backend for auth. How do this backend part? also what this UX look like?
        * UX:
          * PARTICLE LOGIN: user logs in with google/phone/social -> no wallet sig asked for (so really they are only authed to Particle, but not to my app)
          * PING BACKEND WITH userInfo object: once redirected back to my frontend by Particle, if jwt already then do nothing (should never happen during this process); if no jwt then ping backend endpoint with userInfo object that contains wallet - so stored ID for user at this time and it will be defined by their pubWallet and particleUUID (all userInfo stored, but these are 2 main things)
          * BACKEND GIVES FRONTEND MSG TO SIGN: backend returns to frontend a msg to sign (sucks another annoying popup i know)
          * SIGN AND SEND SIG TO BACKEND TO AUTH: user signs and sig sent back to backend to confirm auth
            * if user cancels, then they arent really logged in - i wonder if i can force log them out of Particle
          * CONFIRM AUTH AND GIVE JWT: backend confirms auth and send back JWT
        * only way that seems to work is signing using wallet sadge
        * i guess i could also use password from my app - but that kinda sucks to do
        * COOL THING: does allow use of wallet without needing custodial wallet extension installed tho
      * [[2025-04-30]]
        * just leaving note for myself: im getting ready to remove the SIWE aspect of the whyspia login. it will just be logging in using Particle Network social login now, so dont need another popup for SIWE
        * HOWEVER, this old code could be useful in future once people can use any wallet to login instead of just PartyNet. Also once we want users to do web3 actions bc that one sig can create a "web3 jwt"
    * tracking my thoughts on privacy, encryption
      * [[2023-10-09]]
        * it seems like lit actions combined with AA - combined with DIDs and Ceramic - would allow user to store data in decentralized way where they own the data AND all they have to do is sign in to Google
        * issue is if person gets google hacked, then their data is no longer theirs. Only solutions i can think of: 1) plead user to connect their own wallet as backup and set it as additional AuthMethod for that data (will add a small UX annoyance for them) 2) allow Emote to be able to Auth into all user accounts (maybe optionally by user) - ehh not sure i like this idea
      * [[2024-10-25]]
        * actually sounding like i dont wanna use RSA at all
        * learnt: RSA requires key in specific format. public wallets are not in this specific format - they are a hash of PART of a hidden public key that is indeed in that correct format for RSA encryption
        * you can recover full RSA public key from ethereum pubWallet, but it requires signing a message.
        * my new definition for public wallet/address: the string you see - which is a hash of the actual full public key...which is hidden until user signs a message (then code can get it) 
          * there's also a public method that is deprecated but still active that allows people to get your full public key IF using same wallet provider (like Metamask)
        * Q: is private wallet you see just a hash of the full private key - in same way that public wallet is hash of hidden full public key? A: no, privKey is full thing
        * Q: when signing transaction with wallet - i know code can access signature, but can code access private key of wallet?
          * Nope. Can access full pubKey that works for RSA encryption tho.
        * Q: basically another way of saying above Q: can you use ethereum wallets to encrypt data for RSA? or does this not work because youd have to pass private key on one side and code doesnt get access??
          * Correct. 
        * if you passed full pubKey in RSA format to encrypt, you would need to decrypt with literal wallet privKey and i cant do that - i was just gonna check if user logged in with x public wallet and if so, can decrypt (bc if they have JWT tied to that pubWallet, then they signed message and own that privKey). So there's no point in encrypting using the actual full public key with RSA - since privKey cant be got to pass to decrypt
        * think im just gonna have to give power to our DB sadly. i can still do encryption tho based around whether authed to our backend. what im thinking:
          * user auths. this generates jwt obv, but also generates RSA key pair for encrypting that specific user's data. we gotta store this RSA key pair in our DB sadly. i tried and found no other way. will also send this RSA key as cookie just like with JWT (bc i think that's safer than in network response for this data). this key will be used to encrypt any private data (with pubKey) and to decrypt any private data (with privKey) - all on client side
          * to actually encrypt/decrypt, will use "key wrapping" or "envelope encryption". when need to store data, will generate random ass symKey on frontend and encrypt data with it. Then, encrypt that randoKey with user's symKey. Then, store encrypted data and encrypted randoKey. Dont even need to store actual randoKey anywhere and user will always be able to get it back.
          * will note: this isnt ideal bc we do have to store user's RSA key in DB - devs could totes hack that instantly...but it's better than one single RSA key for entire app i suppose
          * will use this similar process for limited access data like pingppl: user is about to send ping. they make list of users it's allowed to go to. they pull whyspiaPubKey of every recip (including themself) - they use this to encrypt the randoSymKey that was used to encrypt the data itself. Same process basically. RandoSymKey will be same for everyone, but encrypted by each recip's unique whyspiaPubKey
        * i looked into Lit Protocol but it no good sadly despite potential - im confident in this
        * okay im set on above strat - dat what i shall do. Once done, i want to make sure all old stuff before integrating Particle works - which it prob doesnt since was using twitter usernames lol. Still thinking users connect by sharing prob the whyspiaPubKey tbh - there has to be some interaction.
        * tbh ASI makes all this useless anyways most likely
        * EDIT: will prob do this one day, but i think for sake of getting what i want done, i gotta just keep all data public for now. i got particle netty working so auth should be possible by mom now. i can note at top of every page that all data is public and that is that
        * NEXT STEP: so next step is figuring out how to connect users with new Particle Netty auth - how would i connect with Mom if NOT in person? i would like to memo encryption stuff i learned tho, but good lessons in there

    * tracking my thoughts on being conflicted and design issues
      * [[2023-11-02]]
        * Talked with Larry and he helped tremendously. At least for now, this is art. I should create it based on what i feel is right. And that means i need to pivot from "Define" to something else. Dont know what to word it, but maybe "Connect"
        * When you get into design, then you may have to think about user and what they want and let go of what you want - but start with art and what you feel is right.
        * Made me realize in that moment - and in most moments- im conflicted about what user wants instead of what i want
        * I clearly knew i wanted what i have in Roam where you connect info to a symbol - but didnt know how to make that make sense to users. Still dont know how to replace "define"
      * [[2024-03-30]]
        * was conflicted when designing no u context bc context has to send extra symbols for app logic. So i talked with Victor and Ben
        * at some point i mentioned people creating their own contexts with just emote api - but i dont even need to think about that - way too far thinking
        * question: do you want to see those 2 additional emotes every single time emote sent in no u context? can i allow user to give permission once and that's it?
        * DECISION: i will have additional emotes as hidden and if clicked, they show. Maybe tooltip to explain what they are too. 
        * im still left with how to design the no u context tho. specifically the 2 paths after clicking emote button on a received emote. 1) if sending same emote back, i guess just show a preview of it? 2) if sending diff emote back, 
        * another complication: you can send multiple emotes at once. You can also send multiple symbols at once and multiple receivers at once. Global symbol modal will defs need to handle this. I think for no u context, i will just allow one user-editable emote back. That way they cannot create more than 1 emote and cannot create multiple symbols or receivers at once. This simplifies complexity of the ui. If people start noticing how cool those features would be, then they get added in easy.
    * tracking brainstorming UX/UI ideas
      * [[2024-02-11]]
        * i could just have a textarea. When you type in it, it autocompletes commands. Or maybe by default it's 1) send symbols 2) map symbols 3) whatever else i had 4) textarea - and then once they create their own commands, their defaults start to change
        * i got textarea with autocomplete commands idea from lazy.so
      * CATEGORY: how to have separation of concerns for different usecases?
        * [[2024-03-24]]
          * maybe in header there is "context" dropdown to choose the context - such as "no u". If you choose one, the entire site changes based on it. Even notifications could be different.

    * tracking thoughts on case importance
      * [[2024-03-14]]
        * i do think it's important, but it has pros and cons. I think different case means different meaning. But if the word polymorphism is created with however many different cases possible, then this gets confusing for users trying to find the one they want. Which ultimately should be a mix of on the user and our tech somehow puts very related symbols together. But for now im just making all symbols stored as lowercase. But then some places like in sentSymbol they arent lowercase...so that could be issue lol. Whatevs 4 now

    * tracking my thoughts when stuck
      * [[2023-12-09]]
        * so i think it may be best to make the MVP simply "send symbols" and then can focus on "mapping symbols" later
        * Maybe i can focus in on desires??? Like user simply posts their desires, which then is posted to automated bot X account, which then Grok can match people to other people based on those desires. Or maybe there's a better niche than desires??
        * Maybe "i want to talk with someone about x topic"
        * yooo users can input from ChatGPT or other places too - not just my website - my website just has super simple UI that autocompletes to simplify
      * [[2023-12-13]]
        * just writing shit
          * UX from person with need
            * my site says "want or need to talk with someone?"
            * It mentions to them to first use Grok to search for someone. If they find someone's post that also wants to talk about x thing:
              * is it their job to reach out to person? A: yes i think so. We should tell them that some people wont see DMs, so may be better to comment on the post and tag them
            * If no-one, then continue.
            * maybe they can choose if it's a want or a need
            * they sign in with X
            * they write in textarea the details of what they want to talk about
            * they submit. it shows the automated bot tweet. it also gives option to go to their profile on Emote or maybe goes automatically idk.
            * Let them know that other person will comment on the post and tag them and they'll get notification on X if there is connection
      * [[2023-12-14]]
        * i feel like the MAIN thing i need to do is build something i would actually use. Definitely not there yet
        * Maybe this project in makes sense as a game? but how game tho? what does system reward user for and with? we already know possible actions 
      * [[2023-12-16]]
        * Imagined facebook days where you literally just click poke button beside someone's name and that was it
        * So maybe create extension for X where poke button is beside everyone's name. If poke sent it gets sent in DM to poked person maybe...if possible - maybe use automated bot since cant send DM from user's account i assume. Otherwise, to get notified, poked person needs to go to Emote and sign up for notification to poke symbol from specific person. 
        * oh shoot, maybe i should create a GPT for this shiz. Bc GPTs have those lil shortcuts that Nick Dobos posted about. You can have lil shortcut for "poke" or maybe user can create their own shortcuts if that's possible
      * [[2024-02-27]]
        * got basic notif system working - you just get notif for every symbol sent to you. not perf but works. realized since this is default, depending on usecase, no follow system is needed
        * but now im pondering what next. what usecase should i really go for: ^TOrOsTCRu
          * 1) facebook poke idea - maybe call "no u" and you can do ANY Emote back, not just the same one. Altho same one may make it easier - can probably do both - just gotta get UX right and simple. Maybe can even send multiple symbols back ^uA_3nA35Y
          * 2) discord status message except for tpot
          * 3) alert when someone enters vibecafe
          * 4) sending messages to someone in future, like your love
          * 5) single button to confirm yes you need someone to listen to you and sends Emote - which then is similar to FB pokes on this usecase frontend in that someone has to "respond" for it to be completed - or maybe it has to be marked done or something idk
        * for many of these usecases, it seems i'd probably need homepages for each usecase - or itll prob be too complex for most people - uncertain how to display usecases to user
        * since easiest and doesnt require follows table in DB, gonna do facebook poke idea. Im thinking ill make url route for usecases (or smth like that) and then try to fit entire usecase on one page
        * found out fb pokes are still a thing. all lives on one page wow. can get them in notifs and then just takes you to that page. big realization is that you cant poke again until they poke you back.
        * just got poke back from mom as notif without even opening phone yet. Making me realize it would be cool to get something like that except it's like "shmoji sent a desire", Which would require multiple Emotes at once. One to say sending desire and one to say the desire itself. I guess the point of this isnt to wait for other person to respond - it's more like you can follow all desires of person or specific ones and then get notified of them.
        * just talked with James and idea does resonate with both of us, but maybe hard to find that ground between sending a message and getting email. His example is that it would be awesome to just send out everytime he is going fishing and then anyone can join if they want. ^_QoM7x_LB
        * i liked his framing of friends. Came up after i said often i want to do something very specific but isnt something id put in group chat. And he mentioned not wanting to bother others. I liked these thoughts with regards to following specific events from frens that you want to get notified of. Maybe youll ignore most, but not all when moments align.
      * [[2024-05-23]]
        * been working on parallel context and it has been hell trying to let data lead there due to real-time values. I decided to let everything be handled by sockets and then emotes are simply agentic. If someone forgets to send emote that they're offline, that's okay and on them
        * i also was feeling lost about handling privacy again - but again decided this will be all public data for now and going into that problem causes too many problems for me for now
        * also since i was struggling with parallel due to fact that socketio is handling most of app rather than the underlying emote data - i was struggling to connect parallel to the more broad idea. But i think it still connects. I dont think the point was to tie all emote data so everything is run by symbols. The idea is that the agentic symbol sending is there if desired, For the individual, for centralized apps/contexts, and for apps that want the whole app to be handled by emotes
      * [[2024-08-10]]
        * pondering on getting rid of concept of emotes totally bc No U context is confusing and doesnt even need concept of Emote to function like FB pokes
        * my gut tells me concept of emote is important. like people know they are just sending a symbol - but the result of that is an emote.
        * i feel i have options:
          * i can add flag to make emotes private or public. by default in most places, they are private and user explicitly has to choose to make public or not. for No U, i could even just force private them so added complexity of user decision to make them public isnt there. Then, would have to add privacy checks in sooo many different places to make sure only emote owners can see their private emotes. emotes will be how people can send symbols using discord or command line. ^UNne4oCQ6
          * i can remove all signs of emote concept. make new data model for No U similar to TAU that is private. Remove emotes from user page (i feel like it's defs gonna come back eventually). This will be much more simple for user on No U context and no more confusing emotes whatever-those-are on the user page. Although, one thing im unsure of - what about sending symbols using symbol page and the main do stuff modal? maybe i get rid of that too for now?
      * [[2024-08-11]]
        * so ive removed symbol page and all ability to emote and display of them. EXCEPT somewhat on NoU. it references emote a lil as a hint. Also, just bc it's easier AND could leave room for me to continue dev of emote - i am keeping NoU using emotes for now. if it breaks, ill change my mind. but this leaves me incentive to build in private and public emotes behind the scenes
    * tracking thoughts on notifications
      * [[2024-03-23]]
        * i noticed this nou page is just YOUR received symbols. Which is different from notifications which can be so much more - especially once you can follow all kinds of things. Difference will not be noticable in beginning especially if nou is only usecase. But in future, diff would be diff between getting message from fren and getting notif from some random subreddit you follow
        * can always filter notif page for received symbols, but then search bar on notif page is for searching notifs, not for searching people to send symbol to
        * i think what i may do is usecases will send another symbol to identify they are x usecase. Then, this will be shown in the actual notifications. When clicked, it will take to that usecase. Or actually prob better to have option in options tooltip that says go to context or something
        * im thinking the nou page will not mark notifications as seen
        * also thinking that notification page is just for seeing notifications and then quick click to get to the actual interactive part of it
        * so im just thinking about it: you get notif. you click notif icon to go to notif page. you click options button which gives tooltip options. you choose to go to no u context. i guess doesnt go directly to that notif tho, it just goes to the no u page (i wonder if that could cause issues)
        * now im questioning all of this lol
        * maybe to keep it simple for now. ill dev this without usecase and integrate into all emotes displayed. you can even respond to remotes that werent sent to you....oh i just realized this doesnt keep it simple. The nou usecase is so much more simple bc the whole thing is sending poke right back to THAT person. But if it's in all emotes displayed, then you gotta think about 1) send response as emote to emote 2) send response as emote to og sender
        * which i suppose i could just only put on the notif emotes and not public ones. then could still be same as nou usecase i think.
        * i just realized for no u usecase, when you respond to poke, you are responding to both the og sender and the emote they sent (which contains sender and other data). Should there be another emote for that, something like "shmoji sent response to emoteID523452". Maybe another emote to identify nou usecase being used.
        * DECISION: notif page emotes have options button with tooltip. for now only one option to go to nou. you go to nou. there is very similar to your user page, but not public. UI looks just like FB pokes. Each emote has options button. Options: 1) send same symbol x back 2) send different symbol back. Once send is pressed, it pops up modal to confirm - also decided to just send one symbol instead of other stuff like talked about in point above. Also decided to do where you have to wait for response to do again - like FB posts - this just simplifies things so much
      * [[2024-06-28]]
        * ran into issue where notifications of JUST emotes is actually confusing things and making pingppl less useable/understandable. Also 2) required an emote to have a notif - but my centralized frontend doesnt always want an emote for every single action - but may still want notif
        * SOLUTION: change emote-notif model to take a notifDataID and notifType. the ID points to DB ID from any DB table. The notifType identifies which table data will be in. Then, when creating notif, it will be known what these need to be. Then when getting notif data, various types of data can be fetched dependings what is needed
        * then you can have notifs without even needing an emote

      * [[2024-03-05]]
        * a 3D or XR game where you just collect stuff (like i love to do in all games lol) and that game/app account then sends Emote sending symbol to user to show they collected whatever thing. Do you want it to be that way or should app send Emote from user's account to display they collected item?
      * [[2024-03-17]]
        * asking self: when would it benefit you the most in your daily life to use silent messaging or telepathy?
          * honestly just to let my friends and family know i love them or im thinking about them. i think about all my friends all the time, but it's rare that i let them know that because so much energy has to go into the process of letting them know (and it's vulnerable which is hard)
          * letting people know the niche desires or goals that i have so they can help in any way. Maybe they have the same niche desires or goals, so it aligns
          * as a BOOKMARK for a path in a vocal conversation that everyone in convo can see. So you're talking in convo, everyone has many things to say but most go unheard bc convos in groups it's hard to get a word in. This even happens between couples - someone will go unheard What if you had a big red button you can press to signal that you had something to say - and maybe can leave yourself a lil note to remind yourself and not forget. Then, later or in middle of convo if someone decides, can tackle that unheard thing. Maybe you can tag if you want this to be heard in THIS convo, ASAP, or after convo, etc (i like this idea) ^uj0wJj8dx
            * this resonates for me bc could definitely experiment in vibecafe with it. BUT, i want to do this at much larger scales eventually where some alone person can signal they need to be heard and then somehow they get matched with the right person
        * im noticing it's not really silent messaging or telepathy that is super useful for me - it seems just having very subtle signals that typically go unheard - be heard - is what is useful
    * tracking what i can do for OTHER PEOPLE while representing whyspia THAT IS NOT TECH
      * some sort of listener service like one in Durham

    * tracking contexts
      * tracking thoughts on contexts in general
        * [[2024-05-07]]
          * yooo what if you (the user) had a ui i made to literally allow you to create a context? this partially makes sense to me and partially does not. i think it makes sense in the context of that context will then show up in the parallel context (imagining someone wanting to hang with people in certain context at vibecamp)
      * tracking no u context
        * [[2024-03-24]]
          * user could totally manually create no u Emote from everything context. This would then replace prior no u Emote if they sent one. I guess this is okay? and user can do if they want to
          * already starting to feel need for less limited version of no u. You still have list of received and when you emote back or choose to remove from list - it leaves list. Main diff is you can send multiple emotes and receiver can see multiple at once. So multiple chains instead of 1 
          * should just make no u like this? it's basically just changing backend to not filter for last emote from that sender
          * above also made me realize people would love to see history of these chains
        * [[2024-04-15]]
          * found myself wondering again what is point of this context. why not just get rid of condition to send "no u" emote to identify context? Especially when thinking of sending pokes and other symbols to people using discord
          * But then i looked at all received emotes on my profile and back at no u context emotes. No u context is multiple things:
            * a web ui for a "no u" style interaction. It shows you what you have not responded to
            * ISSUE: it doesnt show you a received emote unless it was sent using no u context (possible fix: maybe could have setting to show non-noucontext emotes too)
            * QUESTION: or should i just get rid of no u emote filter and just display all received emotes - and the stinky pinky point is just the web ui that only shows what you havent responded to (whereas your profile shows all received emotes, even if you responded, unless you use filter)
            * AHA: the good thing about the no u context is that you will not want to respond to MOST received emotes. So if you dont have that filter, then they just start piling up there. With filter, it's just showing the emotes sent using that context
            * You can easily just built that extra no u context emote into the discord bot
            * if someone decides to manually send a poke or whatever without the nou context, it's less likely to be seen by receiver. But receiver can use setting to see those in the nou context if they want. Maybe an ai can even detect received emotes that were likely meant to be seen in no u context
            * maybe some way to hide certain emotes too from context without needing to reply
        * [[2024-04-16]]
          * another key point i realized about no u context is that it provides ui for viewing chains of emotes. Not all emotes (such as ones on profile) will have this feature
        * [[2024-04-18]]
          * just built received and sent tabs onto no u context. Was looking at sent tab and realized emote button still there. Think i will take off bc we want chains to not allow double texts (at least for nou context). Technically you can double text, but you need to start a whole new chain to do so.

          * maybe physics trick jumping thing that tracks how far you got to? should there be checkpoints??
          * i was conflicted for most of day on whether to make this physics game or more like symbol discovery/mapping game. i think both is kinda the answer. ill create it as webXR homeworld with portals to other worlds. First one ill create is the physics game. This makes me happy bc i can finally integrate webXR with emote and each project i spawn in whyspia
          * i also feel urge for some sort of abstract art that is simple and fun to interact with OR simple with large soul - as portal in whyspia - but dont think wanna focus on that as of now

          * this is idea to have tool used DURING convos to have an attached text chat for that same convo
          * one manifestation i can imagine: everyone sees one screen during convo. Whenever people feel they want to be heard, but cant get the idea out vocally, they simply increment a counter that everyone sees for each person. For each increment they can add optional note so they dont forget what they wanted to say. Maybe during convo they can find time to insert what they wanted to say. Maybe not. Otherwise, at end everyone sees quantifiably how much everyone had to say but didnt get to say - then everyone can share and listen (parking lot technique). If some people wanna not stay late, they can leave. If no one stays, at least 1 or more container leaders will be there to listen.
            * idk form of tool, but it's mainly just showing a number for each person. Maybe similar onboarding as Kahoot or Jack Box Games
          * one thing that is hard about this idea is that it has to tried out on some person's convo. This idea isnt the convo itself - this idea is an integrated tool for some convo. So gotta get someone to accept this experiment on top of their convo.

          * i imagine it as separate mobile-first app that can complement vibecafe
          * this context will bring in need for multiple contexts at once nice
        * [[2024-05-10]]
          * i think in the future, there will be some logic and permissions around joining/viewing a context (which gets complex) - but for now you can join/view any context in the parallel context - no permissions needed
          * in addition, simply choosing to view that context now shows you as a person in that context
          * to simplify, i think im gonna make the parallel context be tied to the frontend webUI. At least for now. This is because seems easiest way to know when user leaves a context.
        * [[2024-05-11]]
          * it got kinda hard technically. i realized there's no way to know when user has closed the webpage. A logout or maybe route change could be detected and send HTTP request - but not a browser close. To detect that you need to use websockets bc then it will detect when ws connection closed
          * another reason this gets hard and for the above is that there seems to be a need for some way to know when users leave a role. when they choose a different context in parallel context. when they decide to no longer be a helper. when they choose to be joinable. many times when choosing to no longer be helper, they dont want to manually turn it off - they just wanna close the tab in their browser and move on to something else. But emotes need to be sent to notify others of this user's state change. Closest idea i can think of: if websocket connection closes, then they closed browser and can send emote saying they left parallel context. i guessss if they left parallel context is first logic to always check bc then that means any emotes before that mean nothing - their session is over for parallel context.
          * some issues: network issues, serverside errors, etc can cause websocket connection to close while user is still active in browser. Need some way for this to not reset their state during these cases. I wonder if some way to put timer - like if connection drops and 10 minutes pass and that same user isnt reconnected - then they gone gone
          * just a note: parallel context is not local first bc it's a real-time thing all about sharing state of self with others (altho i suppose it could be localfirst in ways...but idk if ill focus on that in beginning or na)
          * so summary: websocket close === send emote for that user that they left parallel context
          * remember: sending emotes is meant to be used for logic in internal code AND to be as readable as possible to users (even non-technical)
          * a thought: i really wish this could all be done with data/emotes and not need websockets, but if that was case, exit emotes would always need to be sent manually and that's too much work for users and may not even know manual process. ALTHO, people that wanna do it manual still can by just using same emotes that parallel context uses
          * brainstorming on making parallel emotes readable:
            * x sent "im online" to "parallel"
            * x sent "entered" to "Vibe Cafe"
            * x sent "im joinable" to "Vibe Cafe"
            * x sent "im no longer joinable" to "Vibe Cafe"
            * x sent "im a helper" to "Vibe Cafe"
            * x sent "exited" to "Vibe Cafe"
        * [[2024-05-20]]
          * emote data for help board
            * x sent "help request" to parallel (identifies parallel and that is help request)
            * x sent "i need someone to talk to about polymorphism" to "help request" (timestamp ties this to other emote)
            * maybe no "open" emote is needed, but a close emote will be needed: x sent "emote.com/emote/id" to "help request closed"

        * well i made receiverSymbol an array that can have multiple symbols. but then i realized you could do the same with the symbol sent. so i wondered why not make that an array. but what is even the difference from a user perspective? and why not just do both? what i mean is - user can send multiple symbols stored in one array in 1 Emote triplet AND they can send a completely different Emote triplet IN SAME SEND ACTION. But when would that ever happen and is that too much customizability? Rn only weird example my mind can think of is: you send ['hug', 'poke'] to ['fren1', 'fren2'] and you send ['fuck u', 'ur stoopid'] to 'asshole1' - all in one SEND action - which means 2 DB records with same timestamp

        * i create Emote triplet with symbol going to emoteservice
        * i created Emote triplet saying i created a social media status
        * AS A USER, how do you point that Emote triplet at the social media status?
        * idk if time works bc user could have sent like 15 emote triplets at one time, but only want to link that one triplet to one other
        * user may want to send multiple emote triplets, but have not all ofthem be linked, so doesnt want all to be one symbol....maybe there needs to be way to make 1 symbol from CHOSEN emote triplets
        * user could always create a new emote triplet as metadata. The symbol inside could even be the most important for consensus. Ex: "i created a social media status" and everyone uses that so people know to look for it. You would be sending that at same time you send symbol of the status. Time hooks those together, but feel the user should be able to define that connection to. And they can totally map them, but most people prob wouldnt want to. 
        * so imagine you have symbol for history of sending social media statuses. the mapping is just timestamped list of emote triplets

        * since everything is based on data - especially contexts and their logic, someone could just spam nonsense with specific data (emote pairs) to make it show in a context. Example: sending emote to identify nana context and just spamming nonsense. The only thing i can think of against this is that identity, reputation, and tribe becomes important to protect contexts and filter bad actors out.

          * prompt
            * all data of my app is stored in one table - the EmoteModel (except there is a separate UserTable and NotificationModel)
            * The EmoteModel is simple - it looks like this: "interface EmoteDocument extends mongoose.Document { senderTwitterUsername: string receiverSymbols: string[]  sentSymbols: string[] }
            * Put in english: all data in the app is in triplets. You have a sender, receiver(s), and sentSymbol(s)
            * this is useful because you can understand the data by looking at the triplets (called emotes) - for example: "testUser" sent "im online" to "parallel"
            * REMEMBER: emotes are being sent with all kinds of different values all the time. But each emote is just a database record with that same triplet schema - but the emote is defined by having specific values to fill those triplets
        * [ ] make prompt on what parallel is

    * 1) defining symbols
      * this has 2 parts: 1) what is the symbol and 2) what is the definition of that symbol
      * brainstorming
        * the definition can definitely just be a link to knowledge management app or something else. I say this because i define all my symbols in KMAs like Roam and Logseq
        * Maybe users define symbol in Emote, but also can link their KMA right beside that definition
        * can the symbol itself be a link too?
        * there could be tool that imports all symbols from your KMAs

  * TODO eventually
    * [ ] API to get a user's most sent symbols
    * [ ] Way to paginate a symbol def's pastDefinitions. Currently it is just a list on every symbolDef. You can imagine this causing issue on profile symbols tab when it's displaying a bunch of symbol defs and all previous defs are showing too and each symbolDEf has like 10000 previousDefs

    * CATEGORY: emotes
      * [ ] on ADVANCED MODE: change frontend visuals and logic so receiverSymbol can be multiple in one SEND instead of just one
      * [ ] make backend API route that creates multiple emotes all at once with same timestamp
      * [ ] on ADVANCED MODE: change frontend visuals and logic to allow creation of multiple Emotes all at once
      * [ ] currently user could create emote with the same receivingSymbol multiple times - should i write code to not allow this?
    * CATEGORY: will prob be problem one day
      * [ ] when you unfollow, this makes so notif for that follow no longer shows up bc mongoDB aggregate fetches notif data from other table based on notifType. But that notif record stays in DB. Rn the notif no longer showing up isnt too big a deal, so leaving like this, but could see this causing issues

So you're talking in convo, everyone has many things to say but most go unheard bc convos in groups it's hard to get a word in. This even happens between couples - someone will go unheard What if you had a big red button you can press to signal that you had something to say - and maybe can leave yourself a lil note to remind yourself and not forget. Then, later or in middle of convo if someone decides, can tackle that unheard thing. Maybe you can tag if you want this to be heard in THIS convo, ASAP, or after convo, etc (i like this idea)]]

          * to generate your most personal profile
        * 5) schedule a symbol to be sent at x time. Could send it to yourself as way to replace Google Calendar which already just doesnt work
  * code key points
    * user system
      * anyone can create DB entry for any twitter account. But only owner of account can "login"
      * init twitter login does not delete previous DB entries for that twitter account, for the sake so bad actors cant prevent people from logging in by deleting their login DB entry. Issue with this is that someone could keep adding more and more DB entries trying to login
      * issue: when some frontend part needs to pull all users, it will have to filter out random user entries of failed logins
    * issues/bugs to remember
      * currently when a receiver is added to DB, the casing can be wrong bc it's added how it's typed by person sending the emote. This issue arises bc i cannot query the twitter API bc it's stupidly closed except to the rich. If i could query this, i could get the username with the correct casing
    * planning for stuff
      * if issue appears where people are sending emote they are active in parallel, but never sending emote they are offline
        * this prob means our server went down and never detected the socketio disconnect. In backend docs, i wrote note for only fix i can think of - which is cronjob to detect these edgecases and send disconnect emote
        * i suppose could also pull online/offline status on frontend and alert user and maybe give option to set offline - or maybe even show this status at all times (but show just on parallel context or where?)
        * can even show different online/offline status for the socketio connection and for the emote data

      * when would it benefit you the most in your daily life to use silent messaging or telepathy?

      * i want to create a bridge that helps humans communicate better
      * i want to create a bridge so that humans and ai can communicate better
      * this project is fun (until it's not). Maybe the better thing to say is that the story of this project is fun.
      * to capture and share "internal clicks" or "aha moments" in order to create feedback loops of that
        * all understanding comes from within
        * there's information in the outside world. But understanding and knowledge always comes from within. You read external text -> it triggers understanding within you and then that understanding lives within you
    * what parts of this do i WANT to build?
      * i want to build the protocol for consensus reality. The space explained with symbols. Between. So it's more about changing the overton window by giving tools to the public and not focusing on the backend/infastructure (i think?)
      * i want to show people the mental framework of sending and mapping everything as symbols. The mental framework mixed with the novel UIs/UXs is what i want to build and give to the public
      * i want to build the stuff that i find fun and will also provide fun
      * i want to build the stuff that enables people to express themself in as niche away as possible
      * i want to build the stuff that enables people to communicate in as niche away as possible and be SEEN as much as possible (if they want)
      * i want to build the user experience and ui. Especially the design phase of that. Im not as interested in the backend/server aspects
    * how will Emote be related to personal knowledge management apps?
      * that is where user maps symbols
      * that is where user discovers symbols
    * how is Emote different than personal knowledge management apps?
      * Each page on a PKM app does not explicitly have any meaning. What you write on the page could be anything. On emote, each symbol is an index to a definition. So you could imagine it as a Roam page with one block that says "What is this page/symbol?" - so it's a narrow use-case.
      * You cant publicly send a page of a PKM app to another person like some sort of emote. You can share them usually, but it doesnt have the social media context like emote has
    * assuming this is a protocol, what is it a protocol for? ^NoKx6c8Fx
      * protocol for consensus reality or understanding reality
      * protocol for curiosity
      * protocol for niche/subtle connection and communication
      * protocol for niche user-defined notifications
      * protocol for human output, protocol for sending symbols
        * more narrow versions of this
          * protocol for sending hugs (or any string of text)
      * protocol for sharing niche parts of your mind
      * protocol for you
        * more narrow versions of this
          * protocol to build the public and digital version of you. imagine your FB or X profile - except much more nuanced. You can display anything about you. Similar to a wiki page for you, but even more customizable
      * protocol for automating and creating your digital actions
        * NOTE: this is more of a private aspect of emote...which not focus on any time soon i think
      * 2ndary stuff
        * protocol for recall
          * this is basically what notetaking/PKM apps are for - so this isnt main focus of emote
    * what actually is the tech?
      * basically: the data, some standards around the data, and my centralized optional tech (mostly frontend code and some backend logic for computing contexts and getting/setting data), my novel UX flows (market of desires, etc), any tech anyone else builds around these standards
        * what are the standards?
          * being aware that you can do anything with data - identifying contexts, etc - bc of this there is no vendorlock (but also no guarentee centralized contexts wont vendorlock you - emotes just offer more transparency and understanding)
          * this is extension of above point. emote structure (senders, symbols, receivers) is maybe a concrete standard but idk. Like can people make different schema for Emotes? i suppose so, but some part of me feels that would not interop with Emote...but idk rn
          * apps need to calculate/compute contexts themself (if not relying on my centralized tech) - but also anyone can decide what emote data defines a context (market chooses)
          * apps need some logic to get and set data
      * some core themes
        * you can take JUST the data and everything still makes sense - you dont need an app - you could have all that data on index cards and it all makes sense - sort of file > app mindset
        * anything can be a symbol - ANYTHING
    * Explain it in 1-2 sentences as simply as possible
      * Human alignment. Helping people find a home or community by bridging the gap between people separated by space and time.
