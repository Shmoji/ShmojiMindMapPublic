        * Max Jelinski meeting
          * ear bci
          * raw EEG
          * they have classifiers for tracking specific things that can be used in python SDK
            * jaw clenching
            * eye tracking
            * frequency splitter - instant realtime feedback
            * mental workload classifier
          * only have 1 channel. 1 sensor in 1 ear and ground in other ear
          * can track eye movement
          * 30H battery life

          * can easily detect jaw clenching
          * connection between sensors and skin = impedence

          * no audio in them despite being earphones
          * they keep anon cloud data of your brain waves - good it's anon, but still dont like it
    * tracking thoughts on their path forward
      * [[2024-02-13]]
        * focusing on having their tech be just like airpods with same functionality as their current devices
        * maybe connecting with Meta to add EEG detection to VR headsets
        * connecting with gaming companies for gaming through simple stuff like jaw detection

  * what is it?
    * company making several #[[non-invasive bci]] - focused on in-ear devices mainly
    * their in-ear device: IDUN Guardian
