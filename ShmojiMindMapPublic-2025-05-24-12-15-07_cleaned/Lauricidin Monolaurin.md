    * random redditor: Monolaurin is a strong antifungal and fungal biofilm disruptor
  * questions
    * ive heard lauricidin, or monolaurin is good against candida. i assumed because it is biofilm disruptor. i guess i assumed wrong?

        * Lauricidin, or monolaurin, is indeed believed to have some potential benefits against Candida overgrowth. While it may not primarily function as a biofilm disruptor like NAC or specialized biofilm disruptor supplements, it has antimicrobial properties that can help combat various pathogens, including Candida.
