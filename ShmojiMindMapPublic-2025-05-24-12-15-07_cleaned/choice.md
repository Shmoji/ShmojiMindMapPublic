  * what is choice
    * ME
      * a living being. a living story.
      * it's when something goes from unknown to known
      * Fear consumes choice. Which is why domesticated mind converges towards pure [[causality]] which says that everything has a cause. That would mean there is no choice if true. 
        * Most of that sentence is from PL, i kinda feel like everything probably has a cause, but it's ever moving away as we learn more. Things we thought didnt have a cause now do, but more things are generated
        * But, it's possible that conscious creatures in some sense always have choice if based in love which is based in the unknown.
  * who performs choice
    * You may think choosing is an action performed by self - which renders choice an epiphenomenon of self.
    * [[the immanent metaphysics]] shows inverse of above point is true. Choice has self. If basis of choice is given by [[fear]] and [[love]]  then these 2 energies makeup the innermost nature of our being arising even before self. This creates 2 types of selfs: domesticated and liminal mind; discussed here: [[different types of mind]]
  * questions
    * how does choice have self? i still dont understand that
      * my best guess: love is based in the unknown. You have to have faith in the unknown and make that leap to do action based in love. So...it's almost like the choice happens in the unknown before self happens.
