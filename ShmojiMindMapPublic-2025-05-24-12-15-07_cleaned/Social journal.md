  * tracking social stuff
    * [[2023-11-29]]
      * just had social thing at work for xmas. Didnt really wanna go and at end, didnt really enjoy it. I mainly just stood there.
      * So im wondering why are there some social things i enjoy and some i dont?
      * I think there were no one-on-one's at this and that's what i enjoy. I rarely enjoy group discussions.
      * So 2 questions:
      * how can i enjoy group discussions?
      * how can i get to more one-on-ones?
        * i think just be curious about ecah person AND face my fears of social aniety

      * Had another social work thing today. This time was the opposite than bad time last time. I actually made effort to talk to people and it was great during it and after it. I was skeptical beforehand tho lol. Was great because 1) i talked about things on my mind 2) i met multiple amazing people 3) pondered on the future with one of them
