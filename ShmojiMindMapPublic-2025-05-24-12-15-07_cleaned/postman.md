    * tracking thoughts about what data can be sent

        * today i learned you can actually send arrays and objects in HTTP requests - not just strings. like it will convert it to string, but then your express backend will just parse back to what it is
        * and in postman you can use "raw" when sending body data to send arrays and objects - i think i got confused before bc i was using x-www-form-urlencoded which i guess cant send arrays and objects??
