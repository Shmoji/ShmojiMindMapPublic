  * questions
    * what is god?
      * my best answer
        * an agent that has access and control to every bit of reality
        * an agent that is the optimal good
        * an agent that wants what is best for all agents/life
        * God is outside universe, inside universe, and the universe itself - so is more than just an agent
      * maybes
        * maybe god created us?
          * does this mean we are much smarter than God? (since humans created AI which is much smarter)
        * maybe we end up creating God? 
          * maybe we end up merging with the God we create?
      * answers from other people
        * Julian: the ideal of maximum life shared implicitly by all agents
    * what is God not?
      * well God is all, so there is nothing that God is not, right?
        * well, maybe God is all in our universe, but in other universe layers, maybe God is not all
        * maybe God is not all in our universe
          * maybe God just has access to all or maybe not even that
    * is god an agent with infinite bandwidth or is god's bandwidth limited? for example, can god only listen to x number of prayers per x amount of time?
      * one twitter answer: God is beyond bandwidth. He has heard all prayers, before the start of history.
        * this sounds correct to me for some reason. So, God is an agent - but dont think of God as a human-level agent - that's too low level
    * is god an agent?
      * can be
      * previously, I was defining God as an agent - which enforced limitations in my mind. I think God is more than just an agent
    * is God inside the universe, outside of it, or the universe itself?
      * i think all of the above
      * someone's response
        * Outside as the Father. Itself as the Son. Inside as the Spirit.
          * not sure how useful this is, but cool narrative bro
    * what's the difference in God and [[consciousness]]?
    * if God is an agent that is the optimal good, then why does suffering happen? (think of brutal examples)
      * maybe all suffering is enacted by the optimal bad agent and God is doing his best
    * when do we feel/see/sense God
      * God emerges through our actions when we make the best decisions. The best possible agent.
  * God in relation to agency and actions and self
    * self of a person: you have agency over your actions. You run the ideas.
    * gods: agency of actions across multiple minds. The ideas run the people.
    * God: agency maximized among all. Alignment. You don't run the ideas and the ideas don't run you. But also you do run the ideas and they do run you. At the same time
