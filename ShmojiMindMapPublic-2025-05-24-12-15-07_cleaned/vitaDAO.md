  * questions
    * what is the process for being a person who is tracking and participating in proposals?
      * seems before proposal is opened to DAO, it is discussed and web2 voted on here: https://gov.vitadao.com/c/proposals/11
      * seems this is where you vote on open DAO proposals: https://vote.vitadao.com/#/about
        * double check this: i think you can also find these at https://www.vitadao.global/proposals
    * where to find active formal DAO proposals?

    * CATEGORY: IPTs and IP-NFTs
      * can you make money by owning IPTs or does it just give you governance? does you owning those IPTs fund the project?
      * if i want to make money by FUNDING projects with high potential - should i be buying IP-NFTs or IPTs?
        * so can break this into 2 separate questions too: 1) to fund a project, do i buy IP-NFT or IPT? 2) to basically invest in project with chance to make money from it, do i buy IP-NFT or IPT
  * tech, features
    * IP-NFTs
      * single token representing A PROJECT
    * IPTs (IP tokens)
      * different than IP-NFT - they are tokens that get created from an IP-NFT
      * me: ERC-20 tokens that enable fractional governance over IP-NFTs
      * VITA-FAST is an IPT - it confers (what dat mean?) governance over the IP-NFT which originally funded Viktor Korolchuk's research into autophagy activators for longevity.
      * IPTs turn biotech IP into composable digital assets (are they ERC20s?). Their site: IPTs make it possible for everyone, not just large amorphous entities, to fund and benefit from scientific research. You no longer have to be a millionaire to own a piece of a pharmaceutical or have a say in the direction of an innovative experiment - you can do it using IPTs. Your ownership and governance is verified, secure, and transparent, thanks to the trust and reliability of blockchain technology.
