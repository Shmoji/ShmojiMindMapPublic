  * Questions
    * Why do you want shampoo to be Sulphate and Silicone free?
      * Sulphates strip moisture from your hair and silicones don't allow moisture into the hair instead they cause product build up
      * The main benefits of using Sulphate free shampoo long term are that the hair will be softer, more moisturized and manageable. Hair color will last longer and be more radiant and shiny and the scalp will be less irritated with normalized moisture levels and less prone to greasiness.
