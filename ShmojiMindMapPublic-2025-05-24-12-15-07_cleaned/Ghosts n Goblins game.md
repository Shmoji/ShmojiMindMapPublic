  * my rating
    * 3-5/10 good
    * You'll have fun if you like an insane challenge. The ending is almost offensive bc how bad it is. Absolutely impossible without Switch save states
  * questions
    * how/where to play?
      * Switch Capcom Arcade Stadium
      * Switch Online NES
    * what do you need to know before playing
      * you cannot get past stage 6 without shield weapon. If you beat the 2 satans with different weapon it sends you back to stage 5 - where you can find a shield weapon
    * where to find the shield weapon in stage 5?
      * i think anywhere but idk
    * what happens when you beat the game?
      * after first ending, it says your princess is not there. You then have to beat the entire game again to get the true ending. In 2nd round enemies and projectiles move faster so it's harder. 
      * The more you beat the game, the harder the next iteration is
    * which version is easiest?
      * arcade version was hard af
      * just beat stage 1 in NES version and it's SO much easier to control Arthur in this version. Much more precise control over his movements. I think this makes NES easier, but will report back. 
  * how TOs for arcade version
    * how to kill red devils
      * if you move towards them, they stay same horizontal level and move away from you without attacking. During this you can spam 3 hits for a kill. This seems to mainly only work if you are eye-level
    * how to kill stage 6 boss
      * make sure you have shield - you can destroy projectiles with it
      * Watch my very first X stream for how to kill first satan, then similar strats for killing next one (sorry cant remember more precise details for 2nd one)
    * how to kill final boss
      * cant hit him on ground and cant hit him at peak of jump - have to time it right to hit face on his gut
  * how TOs for NES version
    * how to kill Satan bosses
      * run away from boss, jump, and turn and shoot backwards while still moving the other direction. Do dis a few times and you gud
    * how to kill unicorns
      * crouch and spam that mofo. I did this to kill the 2 unicorn bosses and it worked even tho i had no armor
    * how to get shield before stage 6
      * you'll get one right under dragon on stage 6 in NES version. Not arcade version tho lol
