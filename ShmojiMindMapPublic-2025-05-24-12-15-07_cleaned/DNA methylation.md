  * **DNA Methylation and How To Measure Biological Age**
    * If you measure the chemicals that control the packing and unpacking of the genome that specifies cell type, there are certain sites on the gene that you can measure. The chemical is specifically called DNA Methylation
    * DNA Methylation = 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens
    * Cells add this chemical to DNA. It sticks to DNA as you're developing in the womb to make a brain cell different from liver cell (different pattern)
    * Overtime, there are changes that are predictable. They change in linear fashion. So, if i take your skin cell and measure DNA methylation pattern across the genome (the 6 feet of DNA) in 1 cell (or in 1000s of cells), I can then plug that into a program and it will spit out your actual biological age. This can predict when you will die. This is liberating because we can now slow aging and even reverse it. We can get DNA to unpackage less and even repackage to reverse aging
  * questions
    * what happens to the chemical of DNA methylation when aging is reversed??
