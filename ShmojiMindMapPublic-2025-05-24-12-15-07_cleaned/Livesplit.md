  * Splits
    * Columns types
      * Delta = shows the overall time difference between your current run and your personal best time for the entire run. If you want to know if you are about to PB while in middle of run, this tells you. Downside is that once done running, this one doesnt show individual splits where you need to improve.
        * i definitely prefer this, so you know whether or not to reset or not. Waste of time otherwise.
      * Segment Delta = This is opposite of Delta.
