  * Notes on privacy
    * Snowden recommends dont use email at all. Instead use Signal. Signal has received federal subpoenas and could not hand over anything except date app downloaded and last used. Not even metadata.
  * Different email providers
    * ProtonMail
      * On privacy
        * PM offers up metadata, and can even get your IP, so not 100% secure. I see PM as more for privacy and security from anyone who does not have the ability. So basically only really rich entities can get your data there.
