  * what is it?
    * atmospheric optical phenomena that is bright spot showing up to one or both sides of the sun
  * what causes these?
    * short answer: cirrus clouds OR rare low level diamond dust halos created from VERY cold temps
    * old weather saying: ring around the moon means rain soon. Halos are a sign of high thin cirrus clouds drifting 20k feet of more above our heads and these cirrus clouds often come before a storm (but not always)
      * Cirrus clouds contain millions of tiny ice crystals. The halos you see are caused by both refraction and reflection of light. As light passes through crystals, it is focused in specific directions
    * 2 types of halos
      * 1: low level diamond dust halos
        * insanely cold areas
        * these are rare bc only seen in polar regions or places with very cold temps
      * 2: high cirrus cloud halos
        * can happen anywhere; summer or winter
        * more cirrus clouds there are, the more chance for a halo
  *  note
    * moon halos created in exact same way
    * sometimes these halos mean a storm is coming soon
    * usually the sun dog is part of halo or arc that goes around the sun
