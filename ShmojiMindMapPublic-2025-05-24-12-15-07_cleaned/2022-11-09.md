    * I think i was not burning until after lunch today. I had brown rice, oysters, beef broth, broccoli, boiled egg, banana

    * So my main pain seems to originate just above Adam's apple. I think that then radiates behind jaw that is under ear. Could be wrong tho.
    * I had the above pain all day after lunch. At 7:58pm, i did sinus rinse using saline/xylitol. Right after, the above pain decreased. It still felt just as swollen under jaw/at throat tho.
