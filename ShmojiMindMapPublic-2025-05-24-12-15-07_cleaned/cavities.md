    * what causes cavities?
      * no specific food - not even sugar - causes cavities. Cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar. That's not just a twist in mechanism - this is a critical point. The bacteria feed on sugar and then produce acid that burrows down/degrades/deminerlizes in very focal area called a cavity. There are several of these bacteria, but the MAJOR one is called streptococcus/strep mutans. Not actually bacteria youre born with - it's a communicable bacteria - just like STI or flu or cold. It lives in the mouth, eats sugar, produces acid - then cavities
