  * NOTE: desires in here almost seem like guiding principles. Im not really checking these off like TODO items, except maybe near resolve dates. If they become small and more precise, then maybe move them to TODO list
  * RESOLVABLE DESIRES
    * NOTES:
      * going to sort by importance by using timescales for when i would like these done
      * ive noticed desires seem to be things that may never actually happen. Once there is significant chance they can happen, they move to TODO list
    * by Jan 2025 (1 year from today)
      * i wanna finish MVP for Emote
        * I want to create a marketplace of desires. Then we can all help each other much easier. This idea is either the same or greatly connected to the point below
        * I want to create an app that makes it quicker and easier to fulfil your desires. So, mapping desires to optimal UX flow for each person.
        * I want to create a marketplace of feelings. Then we can all understand each other better. And could help diagnose and figure out health issues.
        * i want to create a project that lets people store their mindmap. Simply they enter a title of a concept and a description of that concept. 
          * blockers
            * this project requires a community
      * i wanna know how to use both web2 and web3 autonomous agents (prob using olas if had to guess)
      * i want to create my AI buddy that is much smarter than me. (currently sort of have this with internet and GPT, but i need my own)
        * blockers
          * Costs big money
          * Not sure of best/latest tools to make this happen

    * by Jan 2029 (5 years from today)
      * COMMUNITY: i want to live in a big community of people like freshman year of college
      * CLOSENESS: i want closeness/romance/love of some sort - closer than my frens as of 2023
        * i want to have a lustful arc
          * i want to experiment with the different lustful sensations that can be felt
          * i want to experiment with the different lustful sensations that i can give

      * FUN MONEY GIVEAWAY CHALLENGES: i want to give away money, but with a catch
        * what are some ex challenges?
          * it starts with:
            * 1) a cryptic tweet

        * how will i give money away?
          * it will be stored in some decentralized way so that it's claimable without anything from me
        * why do dis?
          * KEY: i think it could be an incentive for me to learn tools AND to give money to people if they're gud enough
          * the challenges should be fun - like the halo 3 jump map back in the day
      * INITIALIZE UNIVERSE: i want to create either a large story or an entire universe
        * what is the UX of creating it from my POV?
          * i can casually create new good content for it on a daily basis without much effort
            * since universe is in my mind too, i imagine somehow that's related to this aspect

        * what are the details of that?
          * i want the creation to be interwoven with my identity, my mind, and my online precense
          * i want there to be mystery
        * questions for myself
          * do i want to create a system that generates a story or do i want to create the stories themselves?
            * probably both, but more focused on actual stories rn i think
          * what is driving me to create this (WHY?)
            * INSPIRATION: ive seen many other creations (movies, shows, homestuck, etc) and everytime it makes me want to execute on this
              * what specifically inspires me?
            * i want to create something that people can get LOST in. This is how content i consume makes me feel and i love it
            * i want to create something that builds on itself so people can have something good to look forward to consuming when the next thing comes out
    * by Jan 2034 (10 years from today)
