    * creating digital art using procreate and apple pen
      * [[2024-06-28]]
        * kinda feels like cheating taking some pic from online and just tracing it. But at same time rn i couldn't just look at ref image and draw it - i can only trace

    * tracking thoughts on how to hold pen
      * [[2024-06-29]]
        * pretty sure i found method i like and confirmed helps me draw more precisely:
        * hold thumb slightly bent on left side, index finger slightly bent on right side, and pen resting on space of hand between those 2
        * previously i had thumb/index on bottom/top with thumb straight
        * can still use tip of pin like this too, but just kinda awkward position
    * tracking thoughts on why i want to draw
      * [[2024-07-14]]
        * well i created one image with novel-prompting-thought text on there. the images felt okay - nothing special or like i really wanted to draw them - just kinda needed something
        * ive tried creating images for sake of learning something - and noticing same thing. For this one, i need to draw chewing and swallowing for part of digestive process learning, but dont really want to draw that. i like idea of just using chewing goku or something. But then maybe this means i shouldnt try drawing based on some idea
        * i think i like the idea of just learning to draw from bottom up - and mostly draw from my mind - and when right do references and idea-prompts
        * i like the thought of my mind getting lost in my hands drawing while my mind isnt doing much. and it flows, yet im still creating something. and it feels physical and my physical movements are related to what is created
        * when creating drawing for some idea, it feels very opposite of this
        * main issue with just doing no-mind from beginning is that i dont think i can learn to draw by just drawing scribbles nonsensically...but maybe idk
      * [[2024-07-16]]
        * maybe process ill continue with: find thing i wanna draw in some moment (like Japanese homes), practice getting reference of diff versions/perspectives of those and drawing them without much thought ^gqzKK8UUJ
        * think it may be too early to truly connect my short stories to drawings. i think i totally could but each one would have very child-like drawing
      * [[2025-02-13]]
        * i finished a comic and i noticed i had no desire to polish it. Like it's just crazy outline where i put no attention into details, BUT story is got across. I also kind of like that there is no polish. But also i feel a pressure to polish
        * i do want to eventually make beautiful polished stuff, but for a comic story - at least this one - i dont think im interested
        * funny enough i saw really messy but really good art from someone else right after thinking this

        * when we can't wonder and turn things into atoms anymore, let's wander
        * when we can't continue the adventure of wandering anymore, let's wonder
        * think when creating it's v hard for me to wander bc i care too much about doing the right thing or wasting time or doing something wrong - when that should be discarded
        * something resonating about: each moment of your life is the art and where the art will come from, you dont have to search it out
  * ideas for formats
    * question, such as: how long from time you eat this food until same food pooped? and then draw art to go along with it and help me remember
    * summary/quote post for more detailed story
    * no detailed story, but short story or idea told
