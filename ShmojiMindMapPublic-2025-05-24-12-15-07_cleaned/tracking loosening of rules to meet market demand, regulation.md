      * Smaller hungry nations may take the lead, for the $ and the PR. There’s $ and PR incentive to nations that loosen rules to meet market demand
      * examples:
        * Estonia’s [E-residency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Residency_of_Estonia), China’s [Shenzhen special economic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen_Special_Economic_Zone), and Singapore’s [crypto regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_cryptocurrency_by_country_or_territory#Singapore). There’s a growing trickle in the medical domain. For starters, Montenegro [recently lightened](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johncumbers/2023/05/12/could-montenegro-become-europes-first-longevity-state/) rules to catalyze longevity research.
        * Most interestingly, Honduras *already* has very light rules for medical testing: Bryan Johnson recently leveraged it to [get a novel gene therapy](https://fortune.com/2023/12/21/bryan-johnson-human-guinea-pig-unproven-tests-reprogram-human-genes-follistatin-roatan-island-honduras/) there; there’s nothing stopping aggressive BCI testing in Honduras.
