  * When someone acts like they understand something, but they clearly do not. 
    * **Why does this bug me?** ANSWER: many times it seems like they are acting this way so OTHER people publicly watching will think good of them. This seems unauthentic. Even if it is one-on-one, it's almost like they are being unauthentic to themselves...which seems odd. Maybe they don't even realize it. But they're basically being fake to make themselves feel good. Wanting to feel good is fine. But this method is flawed because they will instantly feel good for rewarding their ego, but deep down they will generate a bad feeling, due to being fake. Still, I don't like to associate with an unauthentic person. It feels like associating with unauthentic people just teaches me about being unauthentic, which seems way less valuable than being surrounded by people that offer value.
