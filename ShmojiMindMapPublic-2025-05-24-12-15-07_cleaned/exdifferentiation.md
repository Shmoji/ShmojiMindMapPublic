  * what is it?
    * The "unspooling" of DNA in cell. Think of broken VHS tape
    * Possibly the root cause of aging. Possibly the root cause of ALL diseases. David Sinclaire believes this as fact.
    * It's when the genetic info of a cell/DNA has popped out like a broken VHS tape, instead of being tightly packed and only showing part of DNA to be read. Each cell should only allow to be read small portion of (6 foot) wrapped up DNA, but when cell fails is when it can read ALOT of DNA. This makes the cell confused to what it is. It becomes more of a general cell instead of brain/skin/etc cell. Your brain cell may think it is kidney cell--not good.
