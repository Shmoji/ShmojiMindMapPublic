  * my thoughts
    * even if there is not a [[spiritual realm]], i think there is much more value to believe that there is. Tbh i think any controversy is all about definitions tho
  * my confidence
    * i think there is a spiritual realm and over time, it will become less spiritual as we understand more and more of it. However, i think there will be an infinite amount of spiritual realm. So, as we learn more about the universe, some things are no longer spiritual. However, there is still infinite amount of spiritual things left to discover, no matter how much we've already discovered...if that makes sense.
      * replace "spiritual realm" with "unknowns" and this makes more sense
    * Confidence: 100%
