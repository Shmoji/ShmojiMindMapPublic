  * tracking learning what is blood pressure?
    * [[2024-11-18]] blood pressure, types of BP, blood volume, plasma and what make up blood? what are the 3 types of that what lol, 3 types of bloodvessels #memo
      * **Blood pressure** is the force exerted by circulating blood on the walls of blood vessels (key to imagine force on walls). It results from 1) the pumping action of the heart (so force of BP originates from heart contraction) and the 2) resistance of the blood vessels. It is typically measured in two values:
        * **Systolic pressure**: The higher number, representing the pressure when the heart contracts and pushes blood out into the arteries. Cyst...systolic - you pop cysts by contracting them
        * **Diastolic pressure**: The lower number, representing the pressure when the heart relaxes/dilates between beats and refills with blood. Die...diastolic - number dies down lower a bit
        * A healthy systolic blood pressure is less than 120 mm Hg. A healthy diastolic pressure is less than 80 mm Hg. Above this is hypertension.
        * Apparently hypotension typically not as much an issue. ALTHO, can cause POTS - standup, abnormal increase in heart rate (due to being low), then response drop in BP leading to faint/lighthead. Diff name but same thing and common with old people
          * However, common thresholds for too low BP include:
          * **Systolic:** Less than 90 mmHg (30 less)
          * **Diastolic:** Less than 60 mmHg (20 less)
        * got learnt: PRESSURE = force per unit area (so if need to, can convert mm Hg to Newtons/force)
        * Q: what is a blood vessel?
          * TUBEY TUBES: any part of the intricate network of tubey tubes that transport blood throughout the body. The three main types of blood vessels are:
          * **Arteries** - These carry oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to various parts of the body. Arteries have thick, muscular walls to withstand the high pressure of the blood being pumped from the heart.
          * **Veins** - Veins return oxygen-poor blood back to the heart. They have thinner walls than arteries, and many veins contain valves to prevent the backflow of blood due to the lower pressure within them.
          * **Capillaries** - These are the smallest and most numerous of the blood vessels. Capillaries connect 1) arteries to veins and 2) facilitate the exchange of water, oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between blood and the **tissues** (so connected to tissues too). meme: capillary...connected
          * mnemonic: A Very Circulatory/Cardiovascular system...
          * Q: is blood pressure the same through all these? are they roughly the same? and when people measure bp, are we typically measuring that of the veins?
            * No. Not even roughly. arteries = high pressure (120/80 mmHg), veins = very low pressure (2-10 mmHg), capillaries = low pressure (15-25 mmHg)
            * i think obv which one is one we measure. specifically the brachial artery in the arm
      * Blood pressure is crucial for maintaining adequate blood flow to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues throughout the body.
      * hypertension = high BP. hypotension = low BP
        * symptoms to skim:
        * ### **High Blood Pressure (Hypertension) Symptoms:**
          * fight or flight feeling (sympathetic nervous system activation raises blood pressure)
          * Think of "S for Stress."
          * Often **no symptoms** at all (which is why it's called the "silent killer"). iz killer bc extra force causes damage over time
          * Severe cases can cause:
            * **Headaches**
            * **Dizziness**
            * **Shortness of breath**
            * **Chest pain**
            * **Blurred vision**
        * ### **Low Blood Pressure (Hypotension) Symptoms:**
          * relaxed feeling (parasympathetic nervous system activation lowers blood pressure, vasovagal reflex)
          * Think of "P for Peace." or PP
          * **Dizziness or lightheadedness**
          * **Fainting**
          * **Fatigue**
          * **Blurred vision**
          * **Nausea**
        * In general, high blood pressure may not show symptoms until it causes damage, while low blood pressure often results in more noticeable signs like dizziness, despite low BP being less dangerous overall
      * Q: does direction of blood flow reverse between the 2 different types of pressures?
        * No, pressure stays in one direction at all times - with changing pressure amounts based on pumping of heart. Blood always flows in one direction through the cardiovascular system—from the heart to the arteries, arterioles, capillaries, veins, and then back to the heart. meme: veins at end (even alphabetically)
        * Q: so there's a circular path for the flow? it doesnt backflow down the same path when returning to heart? A: YEP, varicocele trauma returns lol
        * Q: what is diff in cardiovascular system and circulatory system?
          * while the **cardiovascular system** is solely about the blood circulation network, the **circulatory system** encompasses the **entire transport system** of the body, including the lymphatic components (so it contains cardiovascular system as child-node. it circulates blood and lymph)
          * memo lymph another time. iz another fluid
      * Q: what is blood volume?
        * refers to the total amount of blood circulating within the body. It is composed of plasma (the liquid component) and blood cells (red cells, white cells, and platelets). Blood volume plays a significant role in determining blood pressure:
        * **Low blood volume** (e.g., due to dehydration or significant blood loss) can lead to decreased blood pressure, as there is less fluid circulating through the blood vessels. Think of water through hose - more water puts more pressure on hose-insides and vice versa
        * **High blood volume** (e.g., due to fluid retention) can increase blood pressure, as there is more fluid exerting pressure on the vessel walls.
      * Q: when volume changes, is it the liquid or cells that change?
        *  it can be due to a change in the **liquid portion (plasma)** or the **cellular components** called FORMED ELEMENTS (but MOSTLY plasma):
        * **Plasma changes**: Blood volume is most commonly affected by changes in the plasma level, such as dehydration (loss of water) or fluid retention. Conditions like excessive sweating, diarrhea, or fluid loss reduce plasma volume, while increased water intake or intravenous fluids increase it.
        * **Cellular changes**: Blood volume can also change with variations in the number of red blood cells (e.g., in polycythemia, where there are too many red blood cells, or anemia, where there are too few). However, changes in plasma volume are more common and faster to impact overall blood volume.
      * Q: what is plasma made of?
        * **Plasma** is the liquid component of blood and makes up about 55% of total blood volume. It is mostly water (about 90-92%), but it also contains all da stuff being transported in it like proteins, hormones, minerals, etc
        * Plasma serves as a transport medium for these components, allowing them to reach different parts of the body and perform their functions.
        * Q: if plasma is 55% of total blood volume, what is other percent?
          * FORMED ELEMENTS: The remaining **45%** of total blood volume consists of the **cellular components** of blood, collectively known as the **formed elements**. These include:
            * **Red Blood Cells (RBCs or Erythrocytes)**: meme: the rrr in erythrocytes
              * Make up the majority of the cellular portion, about **40-45%** of blood volume.
              * Their primary function is to carry oxygen from the lungs to body tissues and transport carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation.
            * **White Blood Cells (WBCs or Leukocytes)**: meme: white guy with leukemia...named Luke
              * Comprise a very small percentage (less than **1%** of total blood volume).
              * These cells are part of the immune system and help fight infections and play a role in the body's defense mechanisms.
            * **Platelets (Thrombocytes)**: meme: i imagine cute platelets from anime lol; maybe one is tomboy, which sounds like thrombo
              * Also make up less than **1%** of total blood volume.
              * Their main function is to help in blood clotting and prevent excessive bleeding when injuries occur.
              * some people say they are not cells and some call them anucleated cells (no nucleus) and some call them cell fragments
      * Q: does eating salt effect blood pressure?
        * more salt = body retains more water to balance sodium levels in the bloodstream. increased fluid volume raises blood pressure which can lead to hypertension (doesnt seem the case for me lol it help me)
        * body retains more water bc there is supposed to be certain balance of electrolytes like sodium inside cells vs outside cells (like stuff learned about neurons). Water is added to bloodstream (mostly from inside cells) to **dilute** (make less concentrated or more spread out) the higher levels of sodium
        * OSMOSIS: water added through osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of water from an area of lower **solute** concentration (sodium inside the cells) to an area of higher solute concentration (sodium outside the cells) to dilute the sodium concentration in the bloodstream - seeking balance through change
      * memo updates
        * [[2024-11-19]]
          * i couldnt remember names of 2 diff types of BP
          * i didnt membuh RBCs are basically all of formed elements and other 2 are not much
        * [[2024-11-22]]
          * think i need to break the mmHg and close parts somewhere else
          * i forgot how much of plasma is water. i mixed it up with how much of formed elements is RBCs
          * added osmosis
        * [[2024-11-30]]
          * i basically knew osmosis. but i was so focused on water. but really water goes from low SOLUTE concentration (like sodium) to high SOLUTE in order to dilute that solute (funny rhyme lol)
          * couldnt remember tension part of hyper and hypotension lol
          * kinda forgot about sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activation in regards to either high or low BP
          * kinda forgot 90 and 60 of hypotension

  * questions
    * why do some people faint when taking blood if sitting up straight, but if they're laying down they dont faint #[[fast memo]] ^MEuzJcrBk
      * vasovagal syncope: This response involves the **vagus nerve** and leads to a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, causing reduced blood flow to the brain and resulting in fainting.
      * syncope is fainting, so my thing is called vasovagal reflex
      * why?: it’s a complex reflex of the body trying to maintain homeostasis. This reflex often works to reduce strain on the heart by slowing down heart rate and dilating blood vessels (which both lower blood pressure), but when it’s too strong, it results in fainting. main thing: It's an energy saving measure in response to stress or injury (maybe for me that stress would be the actual lowering of blood volume itself OR the pressure/stress on blood vessels/nerves from needle)
      * Q: what does dilating mean?
        * think of big ol pupils dilating. In this context, **dilating** refers to the process of **widening** or **relaxing** blood vessels. When blood vessels dilate, their internal diameter increases (bigger hose), which reduces the resistance the heart has to work against to pump blood (less energy used)
        * heart rate lower and vasodilation BOTH lower blood pressure to protect and save energy
      * so reflex is meant to save energy during stressful situations and go into protect mode. it really protects the heart seems the main thing, but also vital organs (hence fainting response trying to help you get blood to brain)
      * izza stress response meant to protect and sav energy...during stress. No idea if evolution will keep into future, i see bugs lol
      * Q: is vasovagal reflex related to flight or fight response?
        * related to different aspects of the body's autonomic nervous system, but they have OPPOSITE effects on the body:
        * **Fight-or-flight response** (sympathetic nervous system activation):
          * This is the body's reaction to stress or danger, preparing it for quick action (either to fight or flee).
          * It is driven by the **sympathetic nervous system**, which increases heart rate, dilates airways, and redirects blood flow to muscles, among other responses, to enhance alertness and physical performance.
          * It **increases blood pressure** to ensure that oxygen and nutrients are delivered quickly to vital organs and muscles.
        * **Vasovagal reflex** (parasympathetic nervous system activation):
          * This reflex is triggered by certain stimuli, such as stress, pain, or fear, but it typically leads to a **drop in blood pressure** and a **slowed heart rate**.
          * It is driven by the **parasympathetic nervous system** and can result in **fainting** or near-fainting (syncope) due to the sudden decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, which leads to reduced blood flow to the brain.
        * A vasovagal episode can sometimes occur in situations where the body feels overwhelmed, as a counter-response to sympathetic activation (fight or flight). For example, when a person is frightened or stressed, they may initially feel the fight-or-flight response but might then experience a vasovagal reaction, especially if the stress becomes too much.
        * vasovagal/parasympathetic activation brings relaxation (sometimes good, sometimes bad). FoF/sympathetic activation brings stress (sometimes good, sometimes bad)
      * gravity and blood distribution: 
        * LESS WORK FOR BLOODFLOW WHEN LAYING: When someone is **sitting upright**, gravity already reduces blood flow to the brain, so the drop in blood pressure from vasovagal syncope can more easily cause fainting. In contrast, when a person is **lying down**, gravity isn't working against blood flow to the brain as much, making it easier for the heart to maintain adequate circulation and preventing fainting.
        * DISTRIBUTION OF BLOOD: Lying down also helps blood flow remain more evenly distributed, ensuring that the brain receives sufficient oxygen even if blood pressure drops momentarily.
      * can be caused by anxiety, but daz not me 98% sure. can also be caused by:
        * basically ur body can see these as stressors that will trigger vasovagal reflex (bc they are stressors) - which then reflex gone too far can lead to fainting/syncope
        * **Reduced blood volume**: Even if the person is relaxed, the body’s reaction to a sudden decrease in blood volume (which leads to decrease in blood pressure).
        * **Pressure on blood vessels or nerves**: For some people, even the act of a needle puncture or the pressure on blood vessels during a blood draw can activate this reflex.
        * **Genetic predisposition**: Some individuals are more prone to this reaction due to how their autonomic nervous system responds.
      * Q: i wonder SPECIFICALLY why puncture of needle for me is such a stressor for my body to trigger vasovagal reflex and syncope - is it due to having too much calcium in blood? something else??? i think mine is blood volume related - bc i imagine that smooth blood draw when i actually did faint out of nowhere while chilling on phone lol
      * memo thoughts
        * [[2024-12-22]]
          * seems vasodilation for both para and symp - but one is lowering and other is highering of BP
          * feel my brain didnt mem quite how this is due to overshoot of 1) lowering of BP and 2) lowering of heart rate (vasovagal reflex) - to save energy
