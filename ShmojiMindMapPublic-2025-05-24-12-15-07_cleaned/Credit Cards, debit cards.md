  * tracking learnings on using debit cards abroad
    * [[2025-02-15]] what is best debit card to use abroad #[[fast memo]]
      * apparently Charles Scwab is best debit card for using abroad (Lim)
        * 1: **no foreign transaction fees**: schwab doesn't charge fees for transactions made in foreign currencies, allowing you to use your debit card abroad without incurring ANY extra costs.
        * 2: **unlimited ATM fee rebates worldwide**: schwab reimburses all ATM fees charged by other banks worldwide, effectively allowing free access to cash from any ATM (MURYOU MOONEY back at end of month)
        * 3: **no monthly service fees or account minimums**
        * 4: seems to work at every Japanese store unlike some other cards
        * 5: INSTANT: exchange is done at moment you pull cash anywhere
        * recommendations:
          * add CS card as external account to regular bank account (this allows you to only put a lil bit like a 1000 on CS and then if need more can always transfer from regular bank account to CS)
          * "don't let the ATM convert": many atms in foreign countries offer "dynamic currency conversion (dcc)," where they ask if you want the withdrawal to be processed in your home currency (e.g., usd instead of yen or euros). this is bad deal bc atm's conversion rate is worse than CS conversion rate. TLDR: so when the atm asks, always choose to withdraw in the LOCAL currency, not your home currency.
      * i think i shall pay with CapitalOne if possible, bc it has no abroad fees (do it for points/cashback). If not, ill use CS. If not, ill use local currency lol
  * IMPORTANT: What to check ALL THE TIME when you own a CC. Check this list before buying anything with a CC
    * Make sure you pay your cc balance in full BEFORE the DUE DATE every month. If you don't, the balance carried over will start accruing BIG interest quick. You always want to pay last STATEMENT balance. Don't need to pay entire CURRENT balance.
    * Want to stay about 15% of credit limit, so try to only spend about $1500 (15% of 10,000) each month. Never go over 25% of credit limit, which is $7500 for me.
    * If there are CC fees, not worth it. Will be different for each thing you buy.
  * What to do right after buying CC
    * Make note of the DUE DATE for making the month's full balance
  * My credit cards
    * Capital One Quicksilver Card
      * Credit Limit: $10,000
      * Cash back on all purchases: 1.5%. So for every $1000 i spend, that is $15 in my pocket. 
      * Bonus: earn a one-time $200 cash bonus once you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening

    * PAID OFF and no longer using
      * I have one with CFNA that only works at Firestone for car stuff. I took out $990.26. Gotta pay off Firestone by 04/05/2023 which is about 6 months to pay off. So pay about $155 each month or pay more to be safe. 

  * Value of cc
    * Preventing fraud. If people screw your checking account, you are screwed, you may not get that money back. If they screw your CC, no big deal.
    * Rewards: cashback, giftcards, miles for flying
    * Interest rates on loans for everything is based on credit score. So if you get good credit score, this can save you thousands due to lower interest rates on loans for things like cars, homes, etc.
    * Coupons. I think this is only with certain companies, such as Capital One. But there's some Capital One browser extension that tells you when buying things that some of these things will give you coupons if you buy the certain things.
  * Using credit card
    * Some companies will charge you extra fee if you use credit card, so gotta be careful.
  * Making credit card payments
    * You always want to pay last statement balance. Don't need to pay entire current balance. 
    * Don't put medical emergencies on credit card unless you sure you can pay it off this month. Make payment plans with medical place. 
    * Probably best to use cc for basic necessities. Use for all reoccurring payments (unless terrible fee for using cc). Not for medical bills usually
  * General notes

    * After while of 1st Capital One card (i think 6 months), you get a 2nd one if doing good. It will be a miles card and you want that because then can get more than cash back. Can get rewards/miles/hotels/etc. 
  * What hurts your credit?
    * Closing a credit card hurts your credit. So once you buy new one, just stop using old one
  * Marty's recommendations

    * Capital One is best
  * Terms
    * Credit Limit
      * How much TOTAL credit/money you can spend. What you have already spent is not factored in here
    * Available Credit
      * How much money you have left to spend on your card before you hit your credit limit. When you go over your available limit, you risk being denied â€” or getting hit with a fee.
    * Purchase APR
      * interest rate charged on purchases made using a credit card IF you do not pay by DUE DATE and a balance carries over to next month
    * Cash Advance
      * NEVER do this. Bc it has crazy instant interest and other downsides.
      * You borrow money from credit card. So you get cash right into your pocket. Then, you could use this cash for payment that doesn't accept credit cards. This borrowed money is added to same cc balance as regular purchases
  * Card options i like
    * Quicksilver - Good cash back options. 1.5% cash back for every payment
  * Notes on credit card options
    * Discover is not taken everywhere
    * Secured credit cards are scams
    * Wells Fargo is crooked. Opening accounts for people without telling them
  * Credit card rewards
    * Cash back is cool, but seems like the gift cards offer better deals (not always). For example, cash back gives about $50 for 9500 Capital One miles/points. Some gift cards will have 9500 points give way more than $50. Same with traveling points.
    * Credit card reward points expire, so be careful
  * Questions
    * What do once move to 2nd card?
      * Just lock 1st card and don't use it. This is because shutting card hurts credit score.
    * Do you need to be careful of **credit limit**?
      * Yes. You never want to exceed 80% of your credit limit. If you get there, then pay it off or make payment to drop it. 80% is actually way too high, real numbers here: Want to stay about 15% of credit limit, so try to only spend about $1500 (15% of 10,000) each month. Never go over 25% of credit limit, which is $7500 for me.
  * Tricks CC Companies use that you can take advantage of
    * 3% transfer
