  * questions
    * if someone wants to buy a light device because they cant get enough light in the morning in the winter, what details should they look for when buying this light device?
      * First, you want a device that emits a high intensity of light. Huberman personally uses a 930-lux LightPad apparently
        * Random internet suggestion: 10,000 lux
      * Second, consider the color of the light. Blue light is optimal for stimulating the neurons in your eye that set your circadian rhythms properly. So, a device that emits a good amount of blue light can be beneficial. Lastly, remember that the goal is to mimic natural sunlight as closely as possible, so a device that can provide a broad spectrum of light might be more effective.
      * Random internet suggestion: 6500K for color temperature
    * what does Huberman recommend?
      * Huberman has not yet recommended a specific red light therapy device. However, he mentioned using a red light therapy panel at home. Huberman stressed that he has no affiliation but that [Joovv](https://joovv.com/) and [KOZE](https://kozehealth.com/) “seem excellent.”
