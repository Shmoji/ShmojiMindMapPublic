  * what they be?
    * me: allow ANY language or system functionality to be converted/integrated so it can be used in JS
  * noteworthy stuff
    * GPT4: examples of JS bindings
      * WebAssembly (Wasm): Enables high-performance applications to run in the web browser by compiling code from languages like C, C++, or Rust into a binary format that can be executed by the browser.
      * Node.js Addons: Allows Node.js applications to run native C++ code via bindings, expanding the capabilities of JavaScript server-side applications.
      * Electron: Uses JS bindings to enable web technologies to create desktop applications with access to native system APIs.
  * questions
    * so, can you just not change the underlying system at all and JS bindings will still let you use that system? or will you have to make changes on system side to allow JS bindings?
      * seems the answer is it just depends lol
