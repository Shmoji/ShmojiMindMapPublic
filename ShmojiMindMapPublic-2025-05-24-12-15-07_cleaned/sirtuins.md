  * what it be?
    * Family of 7 genes related to longevity
    * Silent information regulator (SIR)
    * Meaning of name = Silent means packaging of DNA; silencing *bad* parts of DNA. You dont want liver genome in brain. Information is the DNA and they regulate it
    * Just like AMPK, this family is important central regulator for longevity
    * Fasting and exercise activates sirtuins
    * Sirtuins are part of "spooling" process. They bundle DNA/info in cells, which is V important.
    * 3 of these 7 sirtuins exist in nucleus to control the packaging process. SO,  [[exdifferentiation]] is due to malfunctions in sirtuins
