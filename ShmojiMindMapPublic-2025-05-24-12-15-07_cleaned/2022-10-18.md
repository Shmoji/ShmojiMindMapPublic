    * I've noticed a feeling I get specifically when I try to work on some project or job. I get bad feeling. I think it is brain realizing finiteness of time and feeling bad that time being spent right now may be the wrong way to spend the time. I wonder if this was caused by practicing it while growing up. Because i hated school, it felt completely useless, and like i was trapped. Best method I can think of is to simply try task at hand. Maybe try to replace bad feeling with excitement of future, no matter if current actions are perceived to be good or bad.
