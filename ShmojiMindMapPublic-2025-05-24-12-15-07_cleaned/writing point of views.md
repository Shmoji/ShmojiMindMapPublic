    * third-person omniscient
      * the narrator has an all-knowing and all-seeing perspective that can enter the mind of any character
    * third-person limited
      * the narrator only has access to one (or sometimes more than one) of the character’s thoughts and feelings, while other characters are revealed only through their words and actions. This perspective allows the narrator to present an insider’s view of a certain character or characters while also making judgments on the character’s thoughts or actions.
    * third-person objective
      * the narrator reveals only outward actions and events and does not include any of the characters’ internal thoughts and feelings. The narrator does not provide any commentary about the characters or plot. This technique is almost like a video camera, recording what happens without judgment and allowing the readers to process the story on their own.
