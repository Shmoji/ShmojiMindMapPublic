      * I am excited to apply for this Software Engineer position at Google and believe my skills and experience make me a strong fit for the role.
      * In my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer at ideamarket.io, I was responsible for developing the Node.js backend and a social media-like frontend. I also have experience with docker, web3, and GraphQL.
      * The majority of my development time in my past position was spent building frontends in React and Tailwind, creating APIs, and building MongoDB database structure on the Node backend.
      * I am confident that my experience and skills make me a strong fit for this role. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team and create innovative products.
  * Brainstorming job stuff
    * Can i survive off low paying job?
      * Say I'm paid $10/hour for 40 hours per week. This is $400 per week and $1200 per month. This doesn't even cover my basic monthly expenses. Just rent is about $950
  * My leg-ups over other people when applying to job that i can use in cover letter and talk about
    * I shadowed and directly collaborated with CEOs (Mike) and CTOs (Alex and Mac)
    * 

  * Experience
    * List of Product Manager experience
      * MAYBE: I have a successful blog and YouTube channel where I create technical tutorials to teach development to people
      * I have successfully managed and hired developers and worked with cross-functional teams to deliver successful products
      * I am confident in my ability to communicate about technical challenges and collaborate with engineers and designers on complex technical and UX decisions
      * Reflective listening is important for me, for both users and teammates. I often combine this user empathy with documentation in order to better understand how product needs to change to be better for users
      * I have a passion for building scalable, multi-product platforms that create value for users and I am skilled at balancing the need for feature expansion with operational efficiency
  * Random notes
    * In addition to this position, I am open to any other position you think would suit me. I am interested in doing less coding and more idea-generating/management roles, but whatever you think suits me best works. Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me, such as a cover letter. Thank you!
    * make it shorter and less like you copy and pasted from the job description
    * As a senior software engineer with experience developing web3 products at every layer and managing product and team, I feel I am well equipped for this position. On a more personal level, I have been trying to transition to a position where I do less coding and have more impact on the social side of things, while still working on projects at the edge of innovation. As someone who has been a developer for almost a decade and who gained leadership experience working directly with startup CEO and CTOs, I think being an advocate of developers suits me. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to the success of Aleo.
