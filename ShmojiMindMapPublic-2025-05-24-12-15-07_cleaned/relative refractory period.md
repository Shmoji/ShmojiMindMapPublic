  * what is it?
    * During [[hyperpolarized|hyperpolarization]], sodium channels are closed and inactivation gate opens. There is no change in sodium flow,Â but now they could be opened again..would just take larger than usual stimulus to reach threshold bc cell is hyperpolarized due to potassium still leaving cell
