  * for X
    * MAYBE decision: gonna write literal code that runs with input from user (maybe I just enter their comment) and then i return back return values until someone gets right answer. So if they enter correct input into function then they win. start simple af. don't even need to instantiate self
    * i think it would be good/fun for universe to have some sort of right and wrong - but do i decide that or what?
    * all data stored is related to user's interaction. It's either exactly their input data or data based on / related to that data
    * through interface with me and the functions i make, you can create into this universe without priors - but in order to get more control of universe, you need to go define all concepts in your mind (and i may even add in limitations...if that makes sense)
    * questions
      * do i want all compute/outcomes of universe to come from my mind directly (1) or should some come from code i write (2) or come from static logic i externalize (3) (mixed with my mind running it)?
    * random thoughts
      * if the results of functions is purely random, then it's pointless. IMPORTANT: people need the ability to form a self and total RNG doesnt allow that
      * they read functionality of function and decide how to prompt it based on logic. Then, their input determines their story more than my mind, but my mind does determine good bit too
      * maybe it will be my imagination vs theirs. Their imagination puts their own limitations on user and my imagination also puts more obvious limits on user
      * maybe i shouldnt take it too srs and just try it - if it fails - oh well
      * agency is key - what does everyone else desire (including me)
  * list of things to CREATE for people to DO
    * adventure that only requires clicking and solving puzzles with mind to find end of clicking path
    * beat some game at URL that is accessible to everyone
  * [[shmoji universe random creation]]
  * what do i want to incentivize?
    * People to create their own mindmap
  * mysteries of this universe (exciting stuff)

  * process of creating i like best
    * Creating things for people to DO (even better if it's hard for me to do). 
      * I think i liked creating jump maps in Halo 3 because the jumps i created were even hard for me the creator. It was basically physics based RNG if i got it, mixed with skill of learning the details of the jumps.
      * Examples
        * jump in this 3D world and find clue to solve x
        * Go from this link to this link to here to find solution to x
  * key thoughts
    * This is my universe, so the challenges/interactions i have people complete can be whatever i want. Dont have to pander to some wide audience. Heck, ill put challenges up for halo 3 jump maps that require people to have bought the game!
  * questions for myself
    * why do i want to create this universe?
      * i want to give people actual interactions to DO
      * creating a universe sounds very very fun
      * i think the energy in me is that i just want to give people some exciting lore to continuously follow and maybe get rewards for it 
      * i want to give people crazy lore connections and puzzles to enjoy
    * what do i want it to be about from user perspective?
      * i want it to be about DOING interactions and secondhand the user gets lore through those fun interactions
    * What exactly about this universe do i want to create? What piece sounds like fun to create? What info is trying to escape me? what process of creating would stay fun for me?
      * process for creating characters
        * option 1: find things ive wanted to connect to people on and embody that into a person. Can also use things ive observed other people want to connect on
        * option 2:
      * process for creating events or stories
        * option 1: take events ive wanted to occur or didnt want to occur and make those events and connect to appropriate characters
    * how do i want this universe to be? are there any limits you definitely want?
      * I would love for there to be crazy connections like you see in Attack on Titan
    * when creating universe, do i want to reference my real life or come up with things completely apart from my real life? 
      * Maybe both depending how strongly i feel about whatever is being come up with
  * how TOs
    * how will i make this unique?
      * Most people keep up with lore for movie series or game series. I wanna make something that you keep up with lore, but it's is various formats.
        * Possible formats:
          * Our account tweets lore that rewards people if they keep up with it
