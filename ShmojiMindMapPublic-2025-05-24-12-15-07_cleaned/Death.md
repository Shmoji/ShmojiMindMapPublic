    * What is an organism? Rate how confident you are in your answer.
      * An organism is a set of atoms that execute actions based on intentions.
        * Simple organisms like single-celled life forms seem to execute actions randomly based on intentions built into their biology.
        * Complex organisms like humans seem to execute actions based on desires. We want things and this defines all of our actions.
    * What defines the progression of humanity? Rate how confident you are in your answer.
      * At this moment in time, the progression of humanity can be determined by examining the issues. The more issues being solved, the more humanity is progressing. The invention of the shovel was progression. The invention of glasses was progression. These tools solve issues, which means more desires are fulfilled.

    * Curing death and all issues of the body is the most important task of science right now.
      * The progression of humanity will accelerate once death is cured.
        * Once death is cured, we will no longer need to focus on solving trivial issues of survival.
      * Curing death will incentivize humanity to explore the universe because Earth will eventually run out of living space. The universe seems to have infinite amount of space and it beckons us to explore.
      * Curing death will end up ruining society because greedy people in control will only cure death for themselves.
        * Curing death is inevitable based on the pace of science throughout history.
          * Since curing death is inevitable, we must act based on predictions of that future. If we do nothing, then greedy people are more likely to cure death for only themselves and ruin society. However, if the idea of curing death becomes commonplace, we can implement measures so that everyone can defeat death.
      * Death causes the loss of insane amounts of information, computation, and experience. 
        * The lost information due to death could be what is meant to solve one of the largest problems of the future. Maybe someone else will rediscover the important information, but that is a time-loss. Cure death to avoid loss of information and speed up progression of humanity.
