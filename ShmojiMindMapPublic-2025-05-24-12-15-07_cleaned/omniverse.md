  * how TOs
    * how to view GAME-mode view (how to play a scene?)
      * Press play on left bar and then use viewport window and change Camera at top-left to scene view or game view
  * omniverse apps
    * omniverse showroom
      * it's literally an app to show what's possible in omniverse. So, good place to start when learning omniverse
    * [[omniverse code and create]]
    * omniverse create XR
      * what it do?
        * Still confused, but seems like just a way to view your already created VR scenes. Like play mode in Unity.
        * Using VR with Omniverse Create XR enables you and your team view, navigate, review, and annotate scenes, control lighting, and perform basic manipulations of 3D objects with ease—and all at human scale.
      * when would i use this?
        * I think i can create all my stuff in Omni Code, but then to view with team, can look in Omni Create XR.
        * also good to show to CLIENTS
        * can look at it on phone, laptop, anything
    * omniverse blender
      * You create stuff in blender alone and then it lets you export it so can all collaborate in Omniverse Code/Create
  * omniverse extensions
    * how TOs
      * how to browse for extensions and learn how they work by seeing their source code
        * 1:30 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mehaS6uvniU
      * how to see ALL places some extension/extension method is being used (for examples)
        * 2:00 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mehaS6uvniU
    * what is it?
      * Yo, u can build pieces to make your app work, but also build pieces of the game engine itself (instead of running into limitations of Unity/unreal)
      * With Extensions you can build reusable components and tools. They are the building blocks of Omniverse and they add features to the Omniverse platform. Each extension is written in Python or C++ using [Omniverse Kit SDK](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/104.0/guide/kit_overview.html). Developers have a lot of flexibility when coding an Extension, which can be as simple as a tool for assigning materials to models or as complex as an entire visual scripting system like [OmniGraph](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_extensions/prod_extensions/ext_omnigraph.html).
    * use-cases
      * Consider creating an extension when you need a reusable component or tool. The scope of an Extension can be something as simple as randomizing object positions or as complicated as a viewport renderer. Think of an extension as a plugin.
    * When a developer builds an Application, they do so by packaging extensions together. This is why in their docs somewhere, they mention to dev apps, you need to know basics of deving extensions.
