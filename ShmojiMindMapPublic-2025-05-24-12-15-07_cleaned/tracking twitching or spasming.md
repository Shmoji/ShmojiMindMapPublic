      * Can find what i ate in appropriate notes. Right after dinner, my top left head started twitching on an off. 3-4/10 intensity. I imagine could scare a lot of people. Felt like vein wiggling or something. Possible reasons: 1) mackerel 2) peanut butter protein bar 2 days in row 3) 3-4 bags of chips in 2 days

      * Had spasming for first time since last note. Basically same description. Only strange things i did: 1) i ate like 3 very very sweet mcdonalds cookies 2) drank glass of whole milk 3) have ate chips like 5-7 days in a row
      * Had twitching at top right head and one other place i cant remember well. It was happening during the night while waking in sleep.
