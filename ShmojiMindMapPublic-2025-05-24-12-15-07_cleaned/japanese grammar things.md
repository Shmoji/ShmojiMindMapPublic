    * の #japmemo ^r5XYt-9xx
      * note: has multiple differing functionality depending on context
      * 1) nominalizer
        * meme: nomnom bc it eats errthing up by turning into object/noun
        * turns verbs, adjectives, or clauses into nouns or noun-like phrases. This allows actions, states, or ideas to be treated as objects, subjects, or complements in a sentence (making stuff into objects memes most to me). MOSTLY used for verbs, but sometimes for other things. When used for nonverbs, mainly used to just emphasize in vibe of nomnom used
        * english exs:
          * **Verb to Noun**:
            * Investigate (verb) becomes investigation (noun).
            * Decide (verb) becomes decision (noun).
          * **Adjective to Noun**:
            * Happy (adjective) becomes happiness (noun).
            * Possible (adjective) becomes possibility (noun).
        * when の follows a verb phrase like お茶を飲む - it turns it into a noun phrase meaning "drinking tea" instead of "to drink". But iz more like "act of drinking tea" as object instead of: doing action rn
        * 3 main nominalizers all used in same way:
          * **こと** for formal, abstract, or general statements.
          * **の** for conversational, specific, or personal contexts.
          * **もの** for physical, tangible objects or things.
      * 2) question
        * can be used as a question marker, similar to か

          * の as a Question Marker
            * Soft and conversational.
            * Often implies curiosity or asking for an explanation.
            * Common in casual speech.
          * か as a Question Marker
            * Formal and direct.
            * A straightforward "yes/no" question.
            * More common in formal speech or writing.
        * sometimes a more masculine version adds だ after the の and contracts that to ん
        * のだ and んだ are more assertive or confirming
        * just の at end is often thought as softer and more used by feminine ppl. 
        * most of these hold true even if not a question. Like の at end of sentence can just be used 1) to soften it 2) for curious/explanatory tone
        * IZ A GRAMMAR THING for NANO: **なの** appears when **の** follows a **noun** or **な-adjective** due to grammar rules—it ensures the sentence is correct.
      * 3) obvious one used for ownership
    * なんだ #japmemo ^TMCFsKTvL

        * "Oh, it’s raining!"

        * provides explanatory tone and often used to confirm or assert something speaker believes to be true or is inquiring about
        * LESS OFTEN A QUESTION: なんだ is primarily used in statements to express realizations, explanations, or mild surprise. It can also form questions, but this use is less common and depends heavily on the intonation and conversational context.
    * 何か #japmemo ^Yk42Fyfyb
      * ex sentence: 何か食べたいものはありますか？
        * "Is there something you want to eat?"

        * intransitive = does not require direct object. PASSIVE. The action happens on its own or is self-contained, without affecting another object. in-visible
        * Japanese v often has **pairs** for each verb: one transitive and one intransitive (with no specific rules to tell them apart nice. you just FEEL 2 words are same but slightly different)

      * When combined with interrogative words like **どれ** (which one), **どの** (which), **何** (what), or **誰** (who), **でも** adds the meaning of "any" or "whichever." meme: demo ANY of the choices or ANY of 1 specific choice if interrogative word missing
      * can also come after noun コーヒーでも - this takes the "any" away from choices, but now it's ANY of this specific thing
      * Q: why not use 何か?
        * 何か = dont really have choices - open to anything - unspecified thing
        * どの～でもいいです for when there are choices or specifics
        * どれ is basically same, but not attached to noun. Any one is fine vs any noun is fine.

  * list of common verb transformation things
    * from active verb (like to do) to passive verb (like to be done)
      * 1: First are the verbs where the vowel in the syllable just before MASU ends with "E". In these verbs, before MASU, you insert RARE. So, TABEMASU (to eat) becomes TABERAREMASU (to be eaten)
      * 2: The second type is the verbs where the vowel in the syllable just before MASU is "I". For these verbs, there are two patterns. One pattern is to change this vowel "I" to "A". Then, you add RE, after it, and say MASU. In the case of SHIKARIMASU (to scold), you change RI before MASU to RA and add RE. So it becomes SHIKARAREMASU (to be scolded). SHIMASU (to do) becomes SAREMASU (to be done).The other pattern is you insert RARE before MASU. MIMASU (to watch) becomes MIRAREMASU (to be watched).
      * 3: Finally, let me introduce a verb which conjugates irregularly. KIMASU (to come or to visit) becomes KORAREMASU (to be visited)
    * to causative verb (something causes something else to happen)
      * indicates that someone is **forced to do an action** or **allowed to do an action**
      * depending on verb type, will conjugate differently, but overall seems it adds "saseru" near end as main indicator
  * list of common verbs
    * いただけます
      * means: may i receive, to be able to receive
      * can actually be used at end of another verb to make compound verb
    * おねがいします
      * polite way to say "please" or "i request"
    * りょうかい 
      * understood - seems more casual and less common than wakarimasu
    * いたす
      * yet again another way to say "to do" - this one is PoLiTe
  * 助数詞 = じょすうし = counter word #japmemo ^1F7IBOwQQ
