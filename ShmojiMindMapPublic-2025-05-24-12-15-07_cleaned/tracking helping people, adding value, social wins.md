  * tracking helping people

      * helped Bob today about all day move into home. Felt like such a drag at times bc such simple job
      * But once done and my time was mine again, felt REALLY good. Felt more confident. Felt so much love that i wanted to start texting people i love and miss them.
      * Were these effects from 1) helping someone/social win 2) just hanging with someone and chatting 3) hanging with specific person of specific personality type
      * strategically, this ate up a lot of my time to be doing my own stuff. Yet the outcome is for me in a way too. But also i dont think that outcome of feeling good is always guaranteed.
      * Q: how long will these good feels last?
      * pondering: seems like biology gives some weight to iou's, but doesnt reward them quite like helping someone
      * actually, thinking back: i was pushing out code to millions of people and sometimes didnt even feel this good. So maybe biology is rewarding for adding value LOCALLY

      * today i did same thing of helping Bob. This time did not get any good feels after
      * This time i drove separate. So maybe the good feels really do just come from a good chat
