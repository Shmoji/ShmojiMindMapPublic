  * NOTE: i realized podcast is too limiting, so this is project to simply record what people are confident in
  * tracking thoughts on how to execute this project with other people
    * [[2023-12-26]]
      * Nana said best to give them time to think, but papa said best to do it like i did in the moment with no preparation
      * this idea defs puts pressure on people. Dad and Cristina did not want to talk on camera - it was obvious even tho they didnt outright say no
      * i felt the need to tell nana and papa id talk to them through my phone. i feel that's a good step in the right direction to solve issue of holding phone, but not sure that's perfect yet.
  * questions to self
    * how to start the convo? i feel uncomfy about asking to record and post them
      * "for one of my projects, can i ask you a question and record it?"
      * "for this, talk as much or as little as you want. imagine you had a device that let you speak to the entire world all at once and you're asked - what are you confident in? what do you say?"
      * "anything else?"
    * what are good things to ask speaker?
      * Is there anything else that you're confident about or just want to speak about?
      * How do you feel right now? (does it feel good to talk about what you're confident about?)
      * What are you confident about in terms of:
        * AI
        * Death or longevity
        * The meaning of life
    * im confident i dont like holding camera, why?
      * i dont wanna put pressure on people
        * OBSERVATION: felt like i was putting pressure on Ryan bc he wasnt sure if look at me or camera (pressure on them to talk is maybe okay tho)
      * it didnt feel personal
        * should it feel personal? i know at least part of me wants that
          * i dont think the key point of this project is for me to feel personal - BUT i do think the camera gets in the way due to them not knowing where to look and just anxiety of speaking to camera
      * my arms kinda hurt and shaky lol
    * do i want to ask questions or just let them say one thing and end it there?
      * if i ask more questions - it requires me to be smart and really listen - which may be hard
      * i think for some people i will ask more questions and some people it will be quick thing - depends on me and if there's more i wanna hear or feel needs to be heard
    * what about the process makes me uncomfortable
      * holding a camera. Bc then, how does person know to look at me or camera and that's umcomfy for them.
      * if i force myself to further question them even tho i dont have further questions - that is uncomfy
  * brainstorming
    * why important to mention something they'd tell the world:
      * seems like mentioning something you'd want to tell the world is important. Otherwise may just say something about confident how good meal they just had was
    * dont even worry about asking if can post - just worry about asking if can record. Can talk about posting later.
