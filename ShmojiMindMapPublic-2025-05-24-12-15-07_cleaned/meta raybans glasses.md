        * i imagine life of shmoji videos from past where i take short clips and then make sick video out of them narrating my main memories of the events - these may be perfect for that

        * i need to experiment, but aside from taking life of shmoji vids, i think main reason id use this is to easily travel and listen to some audio - but airpods can do same tbh. And obv audio quality of these are not as good.

  * issues
    * looks like it films vertically like snapchat - i wonder if there's fixes for this
    * bright light other people see when i record would make me uncomfy bc people may get uncomfy

    * you can ask the glasses about thing you're looking at
