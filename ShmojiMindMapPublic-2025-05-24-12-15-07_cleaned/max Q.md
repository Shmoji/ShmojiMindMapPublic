  * what is it?
    * point during a rocket's ascent into space where it experiences the maximum dynamic pressure
      * GPT4: In simpler terms, imagine the rocket is like a car speeding up on a highway. As the car goes faster, the air pushes harder against it. For the rocket, as it accelerates upwards, the air's resistance (or pressure) increases. Max Q is the moment when this push from the air is the strongest. After passing Max Q, the air gets thinner as the rocket goes higher, so the pressure starts to decrease even though the rocket is still speeding up.
      * dynamic pressure = pressure of air + pressure due to air force from velocity of object

  * key points
    * amount of pressure goes up as velocity goes up
