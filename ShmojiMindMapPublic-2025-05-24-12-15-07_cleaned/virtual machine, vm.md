        * today i setup VirtualBox again with lts for ubuntu. it was quick and easy
        * then, i quickly got newest adam launcher release working nice

        * decided on Oracle VM VirtualBox bc it open source and free
        * i tried skipping ISO file and didnt seem to work, so now gonna try again after getting ISO file i want - you can just google to find whatever OS you want and ISO file for it. Gonna be a big and long download btw..sit tight.
        * tbh just use tuts on YT to set this shiz up or youre gonna get stuck at some stupid point. Many tuts failed nice. But this one worked for Mac BigSur https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQJrM7HqezQ&t=48s
