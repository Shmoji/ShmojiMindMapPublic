  * what is it?
    * BROADER DEF: Salt, in the chemical sense, refers to any compound made from the neutralization reaction between an acid and a base, and these are composed of ions.
    * TABLE SALT or TRADITIONAL SALT: The salt that we commonly use in food is sodium chloride (NaCl), which is a specific type of salt. The term "salt" is often used synonymously with sodium chloride, but there are many other types of salts.
  * Questions
    * is it possible to have salt without sodium? is it possible to have salt without chloride?
      * Yes and yes if using broad definition. If using common table salt definition of NaCl - then not really.
    * Will epsom salt bath or table salt bath pull infection out of body?
      * I don't think so because water maybe cannot pass through skin through osmosis...but maybe it can idk. But that makes Marty's anecdote confusing if not.
      * The entire internet seems to have no clue if epsom salt bath does anything for you at all. I researched for hours
  * Difference between table salt and Epsom salt
    * The difference between Epsom salt and table salt is clear at a molecular level. Table salt, also known as sodium chloride, is made up of the elements sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl). Epsom salt, on the other hand, is derived from a naturally occurring magnesium sulfate mineral called epsomite, which contains the chemical components magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S) and oxygen (O).

    * Anecdotes
      * Marty said he has done foot epsom salt baths where black stuff literally came out of his feet. Which must be toxins. Maybe metals or something
