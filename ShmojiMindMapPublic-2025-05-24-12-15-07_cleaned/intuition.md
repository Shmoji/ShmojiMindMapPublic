  * what is it?
    * gordon: intuition is broad and correlative and computationally shallow. logic is narrow and causal and computationally deep
      * me: broad and narrow are kinda opposites. same for shallow and deep. i dont think correlative and causal are tho - not opposites, but defs different
      * so what is opposite of correlative?
        * independent.  In statistics, two variables are said to be non-correlative when they have no linear relationship or when their correlation coefficient is zero. In other words, changes in one variable do not affect the other variable.
      * so what is opposite of causal?
        * non-causal or acausal. In the context of statistics and data analysis, acausal relationships imply that changes in one variable do not affect the other variable, and vice versa. In other words, there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between the two variables.
      * what's the difference in those 2 opposites?
        * Unlike non-correlative relationships, acausal relationships can still have some form of relationship, such as a non-linear relationship, but there is no direct cause-and-effect relationship between the variables.
