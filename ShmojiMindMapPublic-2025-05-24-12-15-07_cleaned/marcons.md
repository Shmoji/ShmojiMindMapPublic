  * what they be?
    * a form of biofilm-producing nasal staph often found in patients with CIRS. These bacteria need to be eradicated for treatment success
  * preferred way to get rid of marcons
    * according to discord:
      * EDTA (recognized biofilm buster)
      * Silver
    * other methods
      * N-acetyl cysteine (recognized biofilm buster)
    * natural methods:
      * Formula 1 NSB
      * Grapefruit seed extract
      * WHisoBAX (witch hazel) nasal sprays
    * no longer recommended
      * BEG spray
  * anecdotes about marcons
    * WanderingJoey from discord: "He missed Marcons with me, ignored the staph suppressing the Marcons from growing on the culture plate and put me straight to vip"
      * so apparently staph can suppress Marcons detection
    * Someone is the cord said when they started treatment, their brain inflammation was horrible, but after 2 months it calmed down and baseline much better
  * what to monitor while treating
    * monitor aMSH levels. Source says "if aMSH levels are not sufficiently robust then re-colonization may be more likely to occur" - but i have no idea what that means
  * random notes
    * suppression of mitoribosomal function associated with marcons
