    * During night my eyes and hair were itchy as a mofooo. Only change i can think of is that i washed pillow cases yesterday. I used detergent and drier sheets. 
    * Stomach pain 6/10 today. I wonder if due to dad's chili. I doubt it bc no one else had this issue 
    * Pretty interesting, whenever my stomach is hurting me in this weird gassy constipated way, it causes my right kidney area to seemingly hurt

    * the burning skin is 5/10 bad today. Head feels pins and needles
