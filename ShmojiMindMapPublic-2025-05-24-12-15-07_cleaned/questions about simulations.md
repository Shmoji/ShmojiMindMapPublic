  * questions
    * why would the simulator create this simulation we live in now (let's assume this was proven to be a simulation). What do they get from it?
      * do they get to experience the qualia we experience?
        * do they get to experience the qualia we experience exactly or is more like when we play GTA? They experience some of our qualia, but not all - more like a mix of theirs and the NPC they play.
