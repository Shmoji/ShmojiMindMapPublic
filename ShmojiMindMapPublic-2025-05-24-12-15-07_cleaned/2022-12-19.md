    * Due to frustrations with people online for past week, i have felt bad. Even affecting me physically. I was literally so hyper focused on other people's negative energy that i got stuck and couldn't get out. I almost started becoming negative myself. I felt my ego wanting to go that direction. As soon as i put focus on a loving human, i got unstuck. Lex posted he wouldn't give into cynicism and he loves us all. It's kinda funny that something as simple as that pulled me back to love.

    * Some results came back today in LabCorp. I guess i dont have Candida bc my Candida antibodies were fine
    * After bad food and beer yesterday afternoon i felt horrid. Weak and my face hurt and head hurt and felt lymph nodes getting bigger. Last night and today i ate iodized salt and this afternoon i feel much better. Could be chance, but idk.
