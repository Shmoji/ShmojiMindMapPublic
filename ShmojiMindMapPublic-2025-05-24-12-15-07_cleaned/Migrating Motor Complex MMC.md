    * how to know it's happening
      * Stomach growl is MMC working. Most often happens in morning. You can notice it bc it's a sound that lasts few seconds. Stomach growling (but not gas) and feeling in UPPER abdomen.

    * your MMC kicks in during a fasting state of 90 minutes or more

      * The action of this complex can be impaired by low thyroid function, inadequate stomach acid (HCl) and deficient bile.
