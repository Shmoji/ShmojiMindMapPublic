  * how TOs
    * how to solve any problem?
      * NOT by editing your emotions based on problem. INSTEAD, by editing your thoughts
  * methods for problem solving
    * Elon mantra/method
      * 1: find right question. question the requirements. make the requirements less dumb. you dont want the perfect answer to the wrong question.
      * 2: delete "the step" or "the process" (this is similar to automation in vibes imo). in addition, if you're not forced to put back at least 10% of what was deleted, then you didnt delete enough. youve gotta delete AND youve gotta put enough BACK IN - "you gotta overcorrect - a cortical override to a limbic instinct"
      * 3: optimize or simplify. 
      * 4: any given thing can be sped up
      * 5: automate it
