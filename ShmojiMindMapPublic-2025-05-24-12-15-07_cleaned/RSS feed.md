  * what is it?
    * my understanding: feed that gets updated any time anything on a site changes. I think when updates go out can be manually controlled by the devs of site. Benefits is that you can see changes in format that is possibly better than the main site. I'd need to experience value from it and come back and record here to truly understand tho - bc rn seems kinda stoopid
  * questions
    * so is it possible for a site to not have RSS feed?
      * Yes. It's a preference thing.
