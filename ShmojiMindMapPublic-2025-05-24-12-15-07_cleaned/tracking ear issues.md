      * had it today for first time in long while
      * it hurts without headphones, but headphones aggravate it even more
      * my only guesses for cause: 1) dark chocolates ive been overreating 2) lemon cookie thins i quickly overate 3) spicy shrimp Cristina made 4) sweet pears Cristina made

Woke up at 3am today and jaw muscles hurt on jaw floor, throat, and at jaw at joint on both sides. Teeth genuinely felt numbish like i was clenching. ears hurt a little. Could greatly feel and hear pulse in ears. left bottom foot twitched, not sure how that's related to TMJD lol. Top nose sinus pain. Lots of nasal drip almost choking me.

Probably have gluten. Woke up in night to vessel pumping sound in my ears that ive had before. Is gluten trigger? This only happens every so often. ]]

      * happened when waking up in night last night. Was definitely clenching teeth last night - certain parts of teeth even have hurt all day due to it. Other possible reasons: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/symptom- bad sleep#^rZnJxZIsU|possible reasons why: 1) few days into taking San Ren Tang now 2) Debbie died yesterday 3) i put 2 week notice in yesterday which was hard af 4) ate grilled chicken Pho which had bean sprouts, cucumbers, some mix of soup, and onions - i think there's a ton of onions which could be the cause of issues 5) i ate too many chocolates too late in afternoon and caffeine OD lol 6) acupuncture treatments are under way - which is similar to point 1]]

      * woke up in night and it was happening. But only when i laid with right ear to pillow and i felt/heard it loudly in left hear. Didnt happen when sitting with back to floor - and uncertain about switching sides of face.
      * it was like 8-9/10 loud and the pulse felt like 5-6/10 intense - imagine some insane looking vein by your ears thumping
      * my guesses why: 1) ate chocolate sugary popcorn for first time around dinner time
    * [[2024-06-28]]
      * had it last night for first time in quite some time - 2-3/10 - only change is i drank ceylon tea multiple times in one day. So, caffeine causes it?? idk. Could just be from jaw clenching in night when idek im doing it

      * yesterday i drank juice of pears in jar from C which is basically pure sugar. instantly my stomach started hurting. i woke up a million times in night and each time i could not get back to sleep and i was having ear pulse issue
      * pretty sure caused by sugar intake. my coil for my braces also just came off yesterday, so that's a possible cause, but im p sure it's the sugar

      * have a symptom where i get loud pulsing in my ears. sounds like a vein that is size of worm pulsating

it's a symptom havent figured out causally

but this afternoon something i ate triggered it. And it stayed...UNTIL i ate some salt and vinegar chips...and then it disappeared...

often, i dont notice the pulsing until i put my ear to a pillow. so to notice it without ear on a pillow and get triggered that quick. i gotta go through each ingredient i consumed. And then think about the salt and vinegar chips related to that
      * happened after eating dinner. i ate:
        * taco meat (whatever she cooked them in), 2 hard shell tacos, 3 bochi (monggo beans, glutenous rice, what sweetens it??), lettuce, olives, tomato slices
      * my best guess: sugar in bochi
