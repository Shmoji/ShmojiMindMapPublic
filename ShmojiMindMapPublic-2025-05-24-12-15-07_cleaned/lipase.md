  * what is it?
    *  an enzyme that helps break down fats in the digestive system
    * FUNCTION: breaks down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Essential for digestion and absorption of dietary fats
    * PRODUCED BY: primarily the pancreas, but also found in stomach and mouth
  * questions
    * how to diagnose chronic pancreatitis?
      * reddit person who got dx: steatorrhea and lipase level test
    * what does high lipase levels mean / what caused it?
      * usually associated with pancreatic inflammation or other gastrointestinal issues
      * generally, there's many things that can cause lipase levels to spike
      * more precisely:
        * lipase levels are high because of high levels of **triglycerides** in your blood. Lipase is your body's way of trying to lower triglycerides, because they are the enzymes that digest fats and they are secreted by your pancreas.
        * triglycerides and not lipase itself is what causes certain types of acute pancreatic episodes.
        * LDL/HDL balance is also a common issue. LDL stands for "low-density lipoproteins" and because they are squishy and large (low density), they can clog your pancreas. The reason they are large and squishy is in part because they're storing the excess fats in your blood, and in part because cholesterol is intercalatingÂ the fats, causing them to be large and squishy.
          * Lipid Rescue (phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl inositol, phosphatidyl ethanolamine) is very related to cholesterol
            * Phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl inositol, and phosphatidyl ethanolamine are types of phospholipids, which are essential components of cell membranes. They play a role in various cellular functions, including the structure and function of lipoproteins, which are involved in cholesterol transport.
            * Here's how these phospholipids are related to cholesterol:
              * Component of Lipoproteins: Cholesterol is transported through the blood by lipoproteins, such as LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). Phospholipids, including the ones you mentioned, are essential components of the outer shell of these lipoproteins, providing stability and solubility.
              * Cell Membrane Structure: Both cholesterol and phospholipids are integral parts of cell membranes. Cholesterol helps regulate the fluidity and stability of the membrane, while phospholipids form the basic structure.
              * Liver Function: Phosphatidyl choline, in particular, is involved in the production and secretion of VLDL (very low-density lipoprotein) in the liver. VLDL carries triglycerides and cholesterol to tissues. A deficiency in phosphatidyl choline could potentially affect cholesterol metabolism.
              * Dietary Sources: Some of the dietary sources of these phospholipids, such as eggs and liver, also contain cholesterol. However, dietary cholesterol has a minimal effect on blood cholesterol levels for most people.
              * Supplements and Therapeutic Uses: Some supplements containing these phospholipids are marketed for cholesterol management, although the evidence supporting their effectiveness varies.
        * According to reddit person: These (triglycerides/LDL) are the real enemy and you should get blood work done regularly. Consult with your GP about "hypertriglyceridemia"
