  * what it be?
    * accepting all POVs - even 2 that seem to be opposites
    * some may say it is walking the middle ground
    * a. Thesis: The initial idea or concept.
b. Antithesis: The opposing or contradictory idea.
c. Synthesis: The resolution that arises from the interaction between the thesis and antithesis, which often transcends the limitations of both.
  * why this is important
    * many times all POVs are correct, but POVs are different
    * when thinking of a "middle path" we often think of 2 extremes on gradient (1 axis). But sometimes the POVs are actually orthogonal (related but independent) to each other
    * Ex: 2 2D observers seeing cylinder as circle and rectangle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Fs4zS3COJQ
    * Reality is often incomplete from one POV - and all are needed
  * questions
    * what is difference in dialectical thinking and nondual thinking?
      * nondual transcends duality by seeing the oneness or unity in all things. In this perspective, there is no separation between self and other, subject and object, or any other dichotomies.
      * dialectical thinking is not focused on unity of all things. It's more like - 2 opposite things and they come together to transcend limits of both.
