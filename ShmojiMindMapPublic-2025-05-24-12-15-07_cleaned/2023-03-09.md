    * When i am forced to talk about something i have no interest in, i hate it. I am interested in things that add value. When G talked about corp things that i didnt think would be work for me, i zoned out.
    * When people force illogical things, it makes me feel bad. Because i want to listen and make others feel good, but im logical. Like when K told me to move closer during standup when obv it could hear me from there.
    * When my face doesnt give comforting positive emotions when someone else is laughing or being happy, makes me feel bad. I think because of Fe.
