  * what it do?
    * in genome is specification of proteins (microlevel hardware that each cell gets to have)
  * notes
    * nothing in genome about size, symmetry, shape, etc - so how do cell groups know what to make and when to stop growing
    * genetics does not specific hardwired rearrangements (like for GMO frog that turns into normal frog) - it specifies a system that executes a highly flexible program that can recognize unexpected states and take corrective action
