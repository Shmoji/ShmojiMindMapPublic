  * PROs of streaming
    * Best way to make many friends. I am computer guy, but i also love meeting people. If i got big in streaming, I have chance to meet TONS of people quickly. I bet many would become lifelong friends. Whereas, I almost never meet people by just going out, especially when by myself. Only time I do is when meeting friends of friends or at some event or at work. Even then, gotta get real lucky for them to become friends. So, streaming is best way to meet as many people as possible and make as many friends as possible. Which I want because I love people
    * As a career, it would be so fun and relaxing
  * CONS of streaming
    * Pains in face can often bother me, especially when talking and streaming often requires constant talking
    * It's really really hard to get a consistent audience. But this could be a PRO too, could be a challenge
    * Downloading/uploading/editing streams and clips to put on YouTube takes a lot of time
      * Methods to fix this issue
        * Place all VODs on capture card, so can get to it at later time. Also, make notes for any clips that may need to be made
        * Just don't upload anything to YouTube. Only stream to Twitch. 
          * CONS
            * This is risky. Twitch career could die in various ways and then nothing is left. 
          * PROS
            * Most people don't watch VODs anyways
