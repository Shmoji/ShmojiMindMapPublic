  * [[Streamer journal]]
    * I have decided to do all streaming on one channel from now on. Made this decisions thanks to my desires here Simple Livestreaming desires
    * I do like that livestreaming on main channel forces me to make progress (i guess due to social element?). So, i may change ShmojiCodes into a channel where i will not do any actions with viewers in mind. I wont even look at chat if i dont want to or may ignore people. I will not talk and explain my thoughts unless i want to. That is most exhausting part of streaming.
    * Came up with EvilShmoji - it is perfect
  * [[Shmoji Journal]]
    * Something i just noticed. If something is fun, it's gonna stay consistent in my life. Ex: anime, video games, learning, etc. Look into fun aspects of everything i want to continue with daily
  * [[automation journal]]
    * i get the feeling that it is much easier to automate very specific things and much harder to automate very broad things
