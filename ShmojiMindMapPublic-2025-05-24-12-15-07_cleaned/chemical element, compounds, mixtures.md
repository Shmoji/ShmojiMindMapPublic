    * [[2024-09-10]] what is element, compound, substance, mixture #memo
      * an element is basically what defines TYPE of an atom - and type is determined by number of protons it has (called atomic number). Hydrogen has 1 proton, helium has 2, carbon has 6, etc. Membuh periodic table.
      * ISOTOPES: atoms of same element can have diff number of neutrons - forming isotopes of that element. HOWEVER, all isotopes of given element still have SAME chemical properties bc they have same num of protons...well for neutral charge atom...but they have diff chem props if they have diff electron counts.
      * i guess isotopes and ions could be thought of as a type of element - layers on layers bb
      * Q: what is a compound?
        * a substance made of 2 or more different types of atoms chemically bonded together (2 diff elements)
      * Q: what is a substance?
        * NOTE: ion is basically a type of element. i mention this bc change one element into same element with diff electron count counts as a chemical change - this process would be due to something chemical and not physical ^7McXVsjIo
        * DEFINED BY CHEMICAL UNITS (element/compound/ion - originating from electron count and how they bond/are-bonded)  and if CHEMICAL BONDED (opposed to physically combined). a form of matter with uniform and definite composition. It has a defined CHEMICAL UNIT and that unit makes it up through chemical bonds. So, substance is defined by CHEMICAL IDENTITY, which is 1) the chemical unit and 2) are they CHEMICALLY BONDED or tells how they bond
        * meme: 2nd letter of substance is u....for unit with definite chemical identity (felt i need meme bc word substance just feels flowy rather than opposite - all about unitizing in chemical way). sub the s
        * just reiterating: substances are always PURE. once they are not pure, they become a mixture. And this makes more sense bc then they are physically combined instead of chemically bonded
        * PURE SUBSTANCE: material made of only one element or one compound
          * PURE ELEMENT: substance made of one type of atom (pure gold, pure oxygen)
          * PURE COMPOUND: substance made of molecules of one specific type of compound (pure water, pure sodium chloride) ^UGser-cWT
        * Q: what is a mixture?
          * consists of 2 or more substances (elements or compounds) that are physically combined BUT NOT chemically bonded
          * ex: saltwater is mixture bc it contains water molecules and salt (NaCl) molecules that are not chemically bonded to each other
          * Q: how are mixtures combined physically if not chemically bonded?
            * individual components of mixture retain their own chemical props, no new chemical bonds form, no chemical reactions - good to remember. Ex: saltwater - the salt (NaCl) dissolves in water, but Na and Cl ions remain chemically unchanged and are not forming new compounds with water - they are just physically dispersed throughout the solution
            * types of mixtures:
              * homogeneous mixtures: where the components are uniformly distributed and cannot SEE individual components. They look like single substance but are actually physical combination of 2 or more substances. EX: saltwater, where salt dissolves in water and forms uniform solution. Mixture is still separable by evaporation but you cannot distinguish salt from water just by looking at it
              * heterogeneous mixtures: components not uniformly distributed and can often see individual components. EX: a salad lol. Or iron filings in sand.
            * how are mixtures combined?
              * 1) dissolving (for homogeneous mixtures): one substance (the solute, like salt) dissolves in another (the solvent, like water). The solute particles are physically separated and distributed evenly in the solvent, but no chemical bonds are formed between solute and solvent molecules
              * 2) physical mixing (for heterogeneous mixtures): mixed together without dissolving or bonding. EX: mix sand and iron filings, they remain as separate particles that you can later separate (like using magnet)
              * 3) suspension/colloid formation: in some cases, particles of one substance can be suspended in another (like muddy water, where dirt particles are suspended in water) or form colloid (like milk, where fat droplets are dispersed in water) 
            * how are mixtures separated?
              * filtration. EX: separating sand from water
              * evaporation: separating salt from saltwater
              * distillation: separating alcohol from water by boiling point
              * magnetism: separating iron filings from sand
              * centrifugation: separating blood components
              * these methods rely on diffs in physical properties of components, such as solubility, boiling point, or magnetic props (not chemical props)
        * mixtures are not substances bc they involve more than one type of molecule/atom mixed together without chemical bonding
      * memo thoughts
        * [[2024-10-26]]
          * i kinda forgot how ion is basically a chemical unit even if it's same element with diff number of electrons
          * forgot about isotopes woops
          * one day i'd like to learn what milk is - is it just fat droplets suspended in water?? - what is colloid? is both mud and milk this?
        * [[2024-12-17]]
          * didnt forget isotope, but kinda forgot it is not a new chemical unit/substance - it keeps chemical identity of element/ion
          * colloids randomly clicked for me without further study lol. For solution, solute is broken into molecular or ion level with solvent. Fat in milk is not broken down like this - they are much bigger. Colloids like fat in milk are not homogeneously distributed either (altho techniques to basically do that are used)

    * [[2024-09-11]] what is chemical property and physical property? #memo
      * my brain compression of chemical: 2 substances interact, electrons change in some way, the more permanent those changes - the more chemical. also even if reversible - newly formed substances are a chemical thing
      * Q: what is a chemical property?
        * **Chemical property** involves the ability to **form NEW substances**â€”whether through combination (like a reaction forming NaCl from Na and Cl) or decomposition (like breaking NaCl into Na and Cl gas) - which is both Na and Cl still, but has different amounts of electrons (so it's a new substance) - opposed to NaCl dissolving in water which is a physical process bc no new substances. So how permanent the change is is big defining factor too - a new substance isnt really always needed for it to be chemical, sometimes its just permanent chemical changes
        * **Physical property** involves changes that do **not form new substances**. Even if bonds are broken (like NaCl dissociating in water), as long as the result is the same ions that existed within the compound and OFTEN/conceptually can be REVERSED, it remains a **physical change**
          * NOTE: Reversibility is common but not required for physical changes it's more conceptually to point out no new substances formed from physical props/process. KEY imo: Physical props are more reversible and chemical props are less reversible (maybe related to energy transfer??)
          * In the case of dissolving NaCl in water, the **ions retain their identity**, so no fundamentally new substance is created, which is why it's still categorized as a physical property. But with **electrolysis of NaCl** into sodium metal and chlorine gas is a chemical reaction because new substances (neutral sodium metal and chlorine gas) are formed
        * how a substance interacts with other substances to form new substances. involves behavior of atoms/molecules in reactions where bonds are made or broken. Ex: flammability, acidity, and reactivity with water are chemical props. These describe how a substance changes its chemical IDENTITY - ALWAYS involving rearrangement of electrons in the formation or breaking of chemical bonds (chemical bonds part is important bc sometimes physical processes involve electrons being rearranged too but substances keeping identity and still *reversible*...so maybe you lost NaCl chem props as a whole, but can be reversed physically to get it back bc solo elements identity still there)
        * good example: Compounds have properties that are different from the properties of the elements that make them up. For example, sodium is a highly reactive metal, and chlorine is a toxic gas, but together they form sodium chloride (table salt), which is safe to consume. It's interesting how the props are all based around the unit and how they bond at small scales and at big scales they appear in much different ways. Also that some can be toxic as solo element, but safe when combined with other element into compound
      * CHEMICAL: this word literally just means: 1) units (elements/compounds/ions) defined by movement of electrons and specifically the bonding they cause between units 2) number of electrons of atom. And it is opposed to "physical" - which are properties observed without changing the chemical props
        * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/chemical element, compounds, mixtures#^7McXVsjIo|NOTE: ion is basically a type of element. i mention this bc change one element into same element with diff electron count counts as a chemical change - this process would be due to something chemical and not physical]]
      * list of chemical props vs physical props for comparison
        * chemical props describe how substance interacts with other substances and how it changes during a chemical reaction. These props are related to the chemical composition and bonding of the substance. List:
          * Reactivity: how substance reacts with other chemical (ex: sodium reacts insanely with water)
          * Acidity/basicity: ability to donate or accept protons (ex: hydrochloric acid is acidic) - but is still based around rearrangement of electrons btw in a more permanent way
          * Flammability: how easily a substance burns in the presence of oxygen (ex: gasoline is highly flammable)
          * oxidation states: ability of substance to gain or lose electrons in redox reactions (ex: iron rusts when oxidized - this is same as fire i think, fire is just MUCH faster version and involves a fuel...idk if that is part of rusting)
          * toxicity: degree to which a substance can harm organisms (ex: cyanide is highly toxic) - seems there's many ways and they all originate from the source causing new substances to be formed in various places (like free radicals)
          * chemical instability: how readily a substance decomposes or reacts over time (ex: hydrogen peroxide decomposes into water and oxygen)
        * physical props describe characteristics of a substance that can be observed or measured without changing its chemical identity. These props relate to physical state and behavior of substance
          * Color: obvious
          * Melting point: temp substance goes from solid to liquid
          * Boiling point: temp substance goes from liquid to gas
          * Density: mass per unit volume of a substance
          * Solubility: ability of substance to dissolve in solvent (salt dissolved in water)
          * Hardness: how resistant a substance is to being scratched or deformed (diamond is v hard)
          * Conductivity: ability to conduct heat or electricity (copper is good conductor of electricity)
          * State: physical form of substance (solid, liquid, gas) at a given temp and pressure (water is liquid at room temp)
      * so, substances are always a chemical thing. once they arent, they are now mixtures due to physical combination. Seems most substances have unique chem props - 2 elements have 2 diff chem props and then they combined chemically and those props are lost but together they have NEW chem prop. Whereas, a mixture often retains chem props of substances since physical combos not chemically bonded
      * EDIT: learned you can get chemical stuff without new substances being formed. Like in bonding of gluten proteins after water is added to wheat flour and mixture is kneaded. Chemical identity doesnt change, but there are permanent molecular changes due to new bonds. (just learned this process has chemical and physical changes - hydrogen bonding is physical but disulfide bonding is chemical, but doesnt change moral of story) Izza chemical interaction, not a chemical reaction since no new substances. ALTHO: this is debatable, some would say the gluten network/matrix is a new substance
      * Alot of time it is based on how permanent the change is. NaCl being dissolved not anywhere near as permanent as gluten protein bonds forming
