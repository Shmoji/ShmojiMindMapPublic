      * [[2024-06-22]]
        * everyone is fighting and lots of flashbacks
        * it's Dabi vs Shoto and Endeavor's team - i think they beat Dabi
        * Shigaraki vs Bunny hero, 
        * All For One vs Endeavor, Hawks
        * crazy girl vs Froppy, Ochaco
        * Deku got dragged to crazy girl instead of where he should be against Shigaraki, but then left to get to right place

        * well, seems Bakugo just died in fight with Shigaraki/All41/Shimura. Looked like he got hit right in the heart. Deku was on the way too
        * Tamaki tried giant blast attack, but didnt work at all

        * All For One used Eri's quirk somehow to reverse his age. He'll be turned to nothing, but huge boost before then

        * Spinner gets Kurogiri out of prison (i think there was device in Shigaraki hand that Spinner put on Kurogiri?)
        * Toga takes blood of Twice and replicates infinitely
        * Dabi somehow still alive and him and all others head to all for one thanks to Kurogiri
