  * key points
    * you dont need to CONQUER the feeling of being overwhelmed. You can unplug/disarm the feeling (make it go away on its own)
    * what causes the feeling of being overwhelmed?
      * a relationship between passive (challenge forced on you that you did not choose) and active challenges (challenge you choose to face) in your mind
      * Dr K summary: your brain chooses how overwhelmed you feel not by # of challenges youre taking on, but how many of them you choose and how many did not choose. Usually we think solution is to get rid of all problems so we have fewer - but really need to choose more problems. It's more about CHOOSING 1 or 2 to focus on
    * Many people think feeling overwhelmed comes from the SUM of all the challenges you are facing, but this is incorrect. Your mind feels overwhelmed when your passive challenges out weigh your active challenges. There are more challenges forced on you right now than challenges you are choosing to face.
    * A common thought and issue: "if life is throwing me lots of stuff, i cant choose to take on other challenges. Im not gonna take on other problems if i cant deal with the problems i have already." - this is often when people give up their active challenges, then the ratio of active:passive challenges goes up - we have WAY more passive challenges now - this reinforces the overwhelmed feeling and this is what causes you to get stuck
    * The solution to the above (feeling overwhelmed or being stuck), is to increase the amount of active challenges in your life
    * By fixing problems that are not the overwhelming problem itself, it makes us feel less overwhelmed (gives feeling of control over life)
    * Then, once you stop feeling overwhelmed, you can go back and tackle the big bads that previously caused feeling of overwhelmed
    * Data proves these notes. Examples includes eating disorders and depression. Talked about in video above.
  * questions for self
    * when i feel overwhelmed in real time social experience, what active challenges can i take on?
    * when i feel overwhelmed at work, what active challenges can i take on?
