      * my current issue is that Duolingo is too easy and everything else is too hard #japmemo ^ZXuLvWIEI
        * me: 私の今の問題は、Duolingoが簡単すぎて、残りの全てが難しすぎます。
        * JonJonJapon: Memriseは試したみたことないですか？
          * meme1: thomas tank engine tries. meme2: tame almost dame and iz no good if u no try
          * ill take alook; ill see - funny tone*: The verb **見る** normally means "to see" or "to look," but when combined with another verb in the **て-form**, it takes on the meaning of "to try doing [that action]". NOTE: sometimes past tense like in this example
          * Q: but isnt 試した already tried? ....so it's like tried tried? A: still works, it puts emphasis on process of trying: so more like "gave it a try" instead of "tried it"
        * me: いいえ、試したことがありません。それは何か特別なことをするんですか？
          * meme1: my special mems going to Taco Bell with church gang. meme2: took bet - if u win, iz special

          * **Purpose of the second te-form:** The second te-form ("聞いてて") indicates:
            * The action of hearing is continuing or has recently been ongoing.
            * It's often used to link phrases or soften the sentence in casual speech.

            * 質問 = しつもん = question. meme: i have questions about the shitsu pokemon
            * "I have several questions."
          * 少し (すこし): Used to refer to small amount of something, but not necessarily countable. It can be used for both things that can be counted and uncountable quantities. Ex: 少し待ってください
          * なんか: often used in a vague or informal context to refer to things that are either unspecified or not important to identify clearly. EX: なんかおかしいね
            * "Something’s strange, huh?" (vague reference to what's strange)
            * meme: okosh...ohgosh wen seeing weird thing
          * ちょっと
            * Meaning: A little, a bit (similar to "sukoshi")
            * Q: so what is difference in ちょっと待って and 少し待って
              * ちょっと is more casual and sometimes slightly impatient (i guess bc closer to "time of a minute/moment" and less vague)
              * 少し is more formal or neutral/safe
          * not really related lol but: とうとう (i guess if request to wait takes long time and finally finishes, then this relates lol)
            * Meaning: Finally (often referring to something that happened after a long wait)
            * とうとう会えた！
              * "I was finally able to meet (you)."
              * 会えた = past tense potential form of 会う. meme: aiii (sound made when finally meeting) or auuu bc we atta met long ago already
              * different than the noun 愛 = あい = love; care
              * 似合う = にあう = to suit; to match; - which is different than 合わさる/合わせる which is like to match together or join together or combine. altho quite similar to 向く (むく) except more direct ^Ck9znWWjW
