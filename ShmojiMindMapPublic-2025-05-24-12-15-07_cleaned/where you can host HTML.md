  * list
    * IPFS
    * Arweave
    * S3 bucket
  * question
    * so i know you can host JUST HTML on all these, but what about more complex frontends with JS and CSS?
      * if configured correctly, you can defs do simple JS and CSS with IPFS - i did this with my NFT - but it's very hacky and not fun
