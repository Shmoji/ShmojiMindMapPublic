  * what is it?
    * #[[event planning, scheduling app]]
    * this is app vibecamp is exploring for getting vibecamp events happening around the world
  * how it work?
    * communities can suggest cities/times for meetups, while providing suggested guidelines for activities and conversation topics
    * If no one applies to host the meetup, it just doesn’t happen!
    * River vets hosts, and sends out feedback forms after meetups, so if someone isn’t a good host, they won’t be able to host again
    * Members can also propose their own community meetups and have them listed under the community page
    * River checks your location so events closest to you are the ones that show up in your feed
