  * what is it?
    * Joscha
      * neurons are oscillators (they go back and forth?) that are resonating with each other and outside outside phenomena.
      * course grain model of universe we are all building together is resonance with objects outside of us. We take patterns on outside world we are coupled with and our brains pass on chemical-electrical signals that can be transmitted across cells
      * so our brains are simulating each other which produces patterns that are modulated (control influence) by passing patterns on
      * speed of signals progression in brain is roughly speed of sound bc of time it takes for signal to hop from cell to cell
        * this is slow with respect to outside world. Take a fraction of second for signal to go through entire neocortex (lots of stuff happening in outside world while signal is passing through brain - INCLUDING stuff in brain itself). Everything in brain (and outside world) is working in paradigm where world has already moved on when you are ready to do next thing to your signal (including signal processing system itself). Quite different than digital computers where you can assume GPU/CPU have same global state
