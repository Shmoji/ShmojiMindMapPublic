  * what are they?
    * sole controller of every document/data they create
  * Types of DIDs
    * Key DID
      * No wallet needed for this one unlike the popular did:PKH
      * as of [[2023-10-02]] - no teams use it - but are interested
      * Generated using some seed you provide. Seed can be literally anything, but should be something not guessable obviously.
      * Only one key can ever control the DID and it can never be changed in case it is compromised.
      * Can find example of how this works in my shmoji-experiments/store-encrypted-ipfs
    * 3ID DID
      * Maybe being deprecated for did:PKH?
  * how TOs
    * how to view data of DID and DIDs in general?
