      * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/2023-04-13#^fGye7Zegt|i think i want to be the dude people watch on YT to keep up with innovation. I can livestream diving into some tech - and people can decide based on my long livestreams or my summarized YT vids...or will ijust post stream idk? Maybe livestreams on coding channel and libofCreations for succinct videos?]]

  * creating YT vid version of Twitch streams
    * 1: download from my Twitch account
    * 2: open kdenlive and load stream in
    * 3: add gain so audio is correct loudness
    * 4: trim any extra from beginning and end
    * 5: add ending outro
    * 6: render video
    * 7: upload to youtube initiate
    * 8: come up with and fill YT title
    * 9: <other YT inputs> = there are several, but maybe not needed tbh - skipping may be better if automating
    * 10: click to upload
    * hardest part for ME
      * coming up with YT title (especially if i dont remember contents of stream)
        * Solution: use free huggingface AI to get transcript, take it and generate an attention-grabbing YT title. If transcript is too long, then generate summary first.
          * This works. Just paste transcript in piece by piece to LLM. Then tell LLM: "The previous messages i sent were a transcript of a youtube video. Can you come up with a list of possible titles for this video? Make it attention grabbing and short"
      * coming up with YT timestamps (same thing)
        * There are tools like this, but very expensive
        * idea 1: YT Q&A and ask what x key moments (most interesting) in video are.
          * algovera worked for this once in terms of listing good summary. But not detailed or accurate enough and it only worked once. Every other time it didnt work. And couldnt give actual times either
        * thoughts
          * didnt think worth time to go through this for gaming stream
      * coming up with clips from this long video, so: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/creating youtube videos#^ZbglyRa4q|creating clips from podcasts or twitch streams]]
        * Kind of same as coming up with timestamps
      * creating YT thumbnail
  * creating long version of podcast after filming it (so not clips)
    * 1: take vid from my computer to kdenlive
    * 2: make sure voice of all speakers are about same level (use compressor effect if not)
    * 3: make sure voices are loud enough. Can google average dB for podcast
    * 4: clip video like crazy until video is how you want it. This will really depend on what parts of video you do or dont like
  * creating clips from podcasts or twitch streams ^ZbglyRa4q
    * 1: take vid from my computer to kdenlive
    * 2: do video to text
    * 3: use text to find parts you want to clip quickly
