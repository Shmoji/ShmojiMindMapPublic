  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Taking sibo test tomorrow. Only mistakes i may have made today is this morning i had magnesium Chloride and honey in my water. Then, i cooked with butter. Hopefully that's okay tho and won't mess up test results
    * Hurting much more today than yesterday. Head pain, chronic weakness, throat and jaw pain. all 4-6/10 intensity. I went on run yesterday is main thing.
    * i definitely feel my health started going downhill after trip to Dad's house. Is this because unhealthy food or biotoxins?
