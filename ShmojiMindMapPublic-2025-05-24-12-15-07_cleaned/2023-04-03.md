    * took one oxy around 3pm. Even with it, i was still in pain. Eventually after laying for a while, i could get position where not much pain, but if i moved, pain came back
    * yesterday i was brain fogged to hell and today i had kidney stone pain. coincidence?
    * my nose starts popping like crazy and mucus in throat when kidney stone pain comes. i think it happens most when feeling pukey, so im wondering if nose pops are related to reflux

    * Using Next.js with tailwindcss, create a page using the data stored in localstorage. Here is an example of that data: [{"id":"0","description":"Integrate Discord server with Twitch stream to create interactive experience for community","plans":"","blockers":[{"id":"0","description":"","chatHistory":[{"role":"system","content":""},{"role":"user","content":"- I want to find way to hookup my discord server as an interactive experience with my Twitch stream"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is my understanding of your situation: "}]},{"id":"2","description":"Uncertain about the costs of implementing the project.","chatHistory":[{"role":"system","content":"\n .\n    "},{"role":"user","content":"- I want to find way to hookup my discord server as an interactive experience with my Twitch stream.."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Here is my understanding of your situation:"}]}]}]. End of example. The page should display the user's goal, their plans as a collapsible component, and blockers of the goal as collapsible components. The blockers can be selected and one-at-a-time chatted with just like ChatGPT.
