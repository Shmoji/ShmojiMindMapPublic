    * after vibecamp, my left-side of upper gums pain is gone. I also stopped my CIRS treatment for all of vc, so maybe related
    * after QRI meditation, the kidney pain was mostly gone - kinda interesting - maybe it was some sort of shadow pain
    * learned i could push through the most intense pain at vc
