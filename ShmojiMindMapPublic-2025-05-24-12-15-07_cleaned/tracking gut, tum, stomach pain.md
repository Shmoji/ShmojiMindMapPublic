You could literally hear gut creaking and squealing. Sometimes it felt like gas and would hurt for second before noise and then release. Makes me think not kidney pain and is gut pain]]

felt like my typical chronic sinusitis turned into a ball of infected goop on left side of my face

some didnt want to move and some slowly started draining while i tried to sleep

got a smell of hand sanitizer from the goop and as it made its way down my esophagus, i started getting twitching and pain all throughout my body - especially in different parts of my gut]]
