      * GPT3.5
        * Light: Green Prayer Plants thrive in bright, indirect light. Avoid direct sunlight, as it can scorch their leaves. You can place them near a window with filtered light or use a sheer curtain to diffuse sunlight.
        * Temperature: Maintain a warm and humid environment for your plant. Ideal temperatures range between 65-75°F (18-24°C). Avoid sudden temperature drops or drafts, as they can stress the plant.
        * Humidity: These plants love high humidity. You can increase humidity by misting the plant regularly, using a humidity tray, or placing a small humidifier nearby. Consistent moisture in the air helps prevent leaf browning.
        * Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy. Water when the top inch of the soil feels dry to the touch. It's essential not to overwater, as root rot can occur. Use lukewarm water to avoid shocking the plant.
        * Soil: Use well-draining, peat-based potting soil. A mix that retains some moisture but also allows excess water to drain is ideal.
        * Potting: Repot your Green Prayer Plant every 2-3 years to refresh the soil and provide more space for growth. Choose a pot that's slightly larger than the current one.
        * Fertilizing: Feed your plant with a balanced, diluted, liquid fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer) every 4-6 weeks. Reduce or stop fertilization in the fall and winter when the plant's growth slows down.
        * Pruning: Trim any yellowing or dead leaves to encourage new growth and maintain the plant's appearance.
