    * Took epsom salt bath this morning and then entire day my jaw hurt about 6/10. Proof of epsom salt bath not working. Pain radiated into my left ear quite a bit for some reason and just in front of it for both ears. Really feel it on both sides just under ear, kind of under jaw instead of on it. 
    * Yesterday my pain was much lesser. I havent ate anything super bad, so maybe this good day was just due to weed the prior day. 
    * I was feeling weak and shaky. I ate some iodized salt and pretty quickly felt better. Think my jaw pain may have got slightly better too. Need to keep experimenting with this.
