    * Visited dads starting yesterday morning. Ate Shoumai dumplings. Probably have gluten. Woke up in night to vessel pumping sound in my ears that ive had before. Is gluten trigger? This only happens every so often.  ^64NrVHftz
    * Also, right after eating dumplings my left bottom foot started twitching. could be the other food i ate, but feel it's the gluten. Not confident in this. I just remembered i also ate yogurt with like 28% of daily sugar that was added-sugar for lunch yesterday. I never eat added sugar so that was rare.
    * had pineapple upside down cake tonight. After eating i really felt pulse in ear while trying to meditate. Didnt sit still all day, so not sure if happening before dinner
    * ball pain was happening all day. But it started spasming after dinner. Lasted a few minutes
