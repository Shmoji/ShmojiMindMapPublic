  * what is it?
    * maybe some sort of membrane?
    * honestly idk yet, but seems related to [[neuropolymer membrane]]
    * possibly just a brand name. And keyword to lead to more scientific terms like:
      * Anion Exchange Membranes (AEMs): This is the broad category under which these membranes fall. AEMs are specialized membranes that selectively allow anions (negatively charged ions) to pass through them while blocking cations (positively charged ions). They are widely used in applications like fuel cells, electrolyzers, and flow batteries.
      * Polymer Electrolyte Membranes (PEMs): While PEMs are more commonly associated with cation exchange membranes, the term can also encompass anion exchange versions. These membranes are made of a solid polymer electrolyte and are used to separate different compartments in fuel cells or electrolysis cells.
      * Ion Exchange Membranes (IEMs): This is a broader category that includes both anion and cation exchange membranes. IEMs are characterized by their ability to selectively permit ions to pass through them, based on charge and size.
      * Composite Membranes: This term indicates that the membrane is made from a combination of different materials. In the context of PENTION membranes, this likely refers to the integration of a reinforcement layer to enhance mechanical properties.
      * Functionalized Poly(norbornene): This specific term refers to the polymer backbone used in these membranes, which is functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups for ion exchange capabilities.
  * what it do?
    * related to anion exchange maybe??
