  * Type 2 Diabetes ^4Evg7MuZX
    * A problem of bringing glucose sugar out of bloodstream and into muscles and brain, which majorly need glucose. If you dont suck sugar out of bloodstream, you will have treacle (caramelized protein) in your system, which is v bad. Another way to say this, glucose attached to proteins..which you dont want.
    * You can measure how much glucose is attached to your proteins using HbA1c test. This tests how much glucose is physically bound to your [[hemogoblin]], which carries your oxygen.
    * High levels of blood sugar predisposes you to many other diseases. You don't want a lot of sugar in your blood (glucose is a type of sugar, and when we talk about blood sugar, we are usually referring to the concentration of glucose in the bloodstream)
    * In terms of aging: Cells that line blood vessels that suck glucose out of system are losing their function (due to [[exdifferentiation]]). There's a gene that sucks glucose from outside to inside cell called GLUT4 (glucose transporter # 4). Overtime with aging (especially without exercise and health), your cells lose ability to make that GLUT4 and glucose will stay in bloodstream for longer which is toxic.Â  So, [[metformin]] does "respooling" and teaching cells to remember how to behave again
