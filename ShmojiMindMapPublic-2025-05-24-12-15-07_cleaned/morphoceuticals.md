  * why im bullish
    * They are enabling tech that will allow humans to REGENERATE body parts
    * This tech will cure many health issues
    * these tools have already shown to work in various organisms. watch this video for more info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmRaIQOlxTY (also lots of good info on their site)
    * $8m seed funding they got is good signal
    * Michael Levin being associated is good signal
  * what is it?
    * company pioneering the bioelectric reprogramming of biology. Their website: https://www.morphoceuticals.com
  * how it works
    * tbh i barely know, but i'll do my best. you can change the bioelectric pattern of a collective of cells and this pattern guides how that collective will form (even more control than genes).
  * key notes
    * Their initial focus will be on Amputation Stump Health and Limb Regeneration; Organogenesis; and on Channelopathies.
  * fun thoughts
    * this tech will probably lead to a future where you can completely control what your physical form looks like
