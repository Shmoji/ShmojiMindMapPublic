  * my take
    * after like 20 minutes of research, im very skeptical of this one. im still willing to try and measure symptoms tho
  * what is it?
    * a dietary supplement that provides concentrated immunoglobulins to enhance mucosal immunity, helps maintain microbial balance, supports GI barrier health and integrity, and helps maintain normal inflammatory balance. It is available in both capsule and powder form
  * anecdotes
    * REDDIT:
      * it can be constipating
      * is expensive
