        * ALL: artists and creators and learners but we accept all. we want to unlock the agency of everyone so they can vibe with life and find alignment/connection with people, places, and rhythms of their life - heart alignment
        * LONELY PEOPLE, AWKARD PEOPLE: lonely people is stereotypical one. Especially lonely in the sense that they want a community, but cant find one
      * PEOPLE THAT DONT VIBE ENOUGH WITH LIFE; PEOPLE THAT DONT FEEL ALIGNED OR   CONNECTED ENOUGH: people that need help or space for heart alignment
      * PEOPLE THAT WANT ALIGNED COMMUNITY: people that want community but dont have it and cant find one. Specifically, a community that is aligned with them. They can do what they want with other people around. Dont have to commit to some sport or one thing.
