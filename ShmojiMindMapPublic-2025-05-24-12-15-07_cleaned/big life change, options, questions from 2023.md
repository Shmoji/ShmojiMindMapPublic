            * JERM payment: $150-200
            * flight to and fro Japan: at min $1000
            * $500 for 1 month in Japan. Add $500 for any more months you wanna stay
            * braces: about $1460 would cover me for about 1 year if payment stays $140 per month
              * i guess i chose 1 year bc that's a long time?? lol
            * Durham rent and utilz for last 3 months of lease: $5400
        * how much do i need saved up so i have enough for all of braces?
          * $2520 - monthly payments of $140, so just having $1680 would cover me for a year
        * biweekly pay amount
          * $2938
          * so by the halfening ill make about $6000 since is 2 weeks
        * how much do i need saved up to spend another 3 months in same apartment without job?
          * $5,400 - including braces payments for those months, but not months after
        * can i pause my student loans?
          * it seems maybeeeee
        * can i get unemployment
          * im uncertain
        * do i have enough savings rn?
          * yea basically, but i consider them investments that are meant to not be touched - is that wrong?
          * gonna at least wait until halfening
      * one-time costs coming up
        * vibecamp: $500
        * flight to and fro Japan: at min $1000
      * monthly costs into the future (~$1800) - add $300 more if i keep therapy and acupuncture
        * rent and utilz: $1000
        * food: $300-600
        * braces: $140 (TODO: figure out what month and year i finish paying)
        * roam: $15 ^O3JmgXTpY

        * maybe car insurance?? idk: $50
      * monthly charges i can definitely get rid of
        * Needle Tools: $20 (already cancelled)
        * $16 - X shmojii
        * $8 - X evilshmoji
    * CUSTOM OPTION 1: save money up until end of lease (or whenever really - maybe choose max savings amount), then renew again for 6 or less months, go all in on Emote and unemployed. If nothing comes from that, then ill just head home
      * brainstorming more
        * getting a cat could incentivize me to make money from Emote so i can keep living alone and feed my kitty cat
        * i could plan to have simple website and simple short demo before quitting job. Then, i can announce Patreon for Emote that is fueled by the short demo and anyone maybe using the actual site
  * questions
    * how much hurt do i feel from a 9-5?
      * 7-10/10
    * how REQUIRED am i to do a 9-5?
      * once i run out of money in the bank AND if i do NOT live at home - basically 10/10 required. If i live at home, then not required, but so many issues with living at home
    * what are good POVs of my past to re-embody to make this decision?
      * JOBLESS AND HOME: after ideamarket when i was jobless, couldnt find a job, living with dad - and it SUCKED
      * DEAD: pov of when at roughest point with health issues and all i wanted was good health
      * CORPORATE but cozy job: everything is good EXCEPT every day what im working on feels pointless
