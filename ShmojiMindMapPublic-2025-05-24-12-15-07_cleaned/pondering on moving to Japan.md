  * list of schools ive looked into
    * Yamano
      * i sent email since their contact form on site didnt work Not much else i can do
    * Tokyo Kogakuin
      * i used contact form on site to get free interview to ask them questions. Hopefully they response. Not much else i can do now i guess.
    * Tokyo Central Japanese Language School
      * just inquired. i guess not much i can do until their visa seminar thing??
    * Kai Japanese Language School
      * used their contact form. Grok said this is most modern of the schools in Tokyo...so i think this is maybeeee my fav
  * tracking

      * maybe i should start now to look for remote job that pays over 70kUSD, then i can get nomad visa. Working in Japan cafes and whatnot. Checking out social spaces for whyspia reasons
      * i could also just get job in Japan, but doubt I'd like that. although, i think I'd enjoy fulltime work here in some social service job compared to any full or part-time work in America - this is because you can actually have life outside work here. There's always tons of meetup events each night
      * could also just do Japanese language school again. 1 year is like 8000USD. Downside is im burning through my investment money to do that and not making any money
      * could also get masters in what i want in Japan and learn language by self
      * BUSINESS IN JAPAN: can start business in Japan to get Visa. it can even be a nonprofit. You have to prove to them. Perplexity gave good list for proving success. I think my third place mission statement is maybe best for nonprofit. But maybe helping people vibe with life too. maybe giving and receiving quests too but idk
      * i know for sure i need to be here in Japan. i know for sure i need to get real good at language
      * so, i need to wait to hear back from Canada and then decide: become student at language school while trying to get nonprofit going OR go to Canada OR get job in Japan (since dig nomad only lasts 6 months, i guess that could be extension tho). Student resonates most, especially since first things first i need to be pro at language. id love to just put full effort on that
      * thank you Montana
        * digital nomad visa CAN be renewed. But maybe only so often. So you wonder: will you get kicked out after 6 months? it seems not bc he's been here longer and as long as you are tidy, you wont.
        * there's also special economic person or something. he said can be sometime be LLC/entrepreneur in ANOTHER country. There's points you get to determine: points for JLP level, for degree level, for income level
        * student visa is awesome. 1 year is about 8000USD

    * [[2025-03-23]]
      * okay, so it seems my route is either 1) student visa (8000USD/year) or 2) startup visa
      * research schools that i should apply to for student visa
        * Tokyo Central Japanese Language School、〒160-0016 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Shinanomachi, 34 トーシン信濃町駅前ビル 4F
          * bit far from KitaSando
        * Yamano Japanese Language School right outside Rico Pua https://www.yamano-js.jp/en/faq-en/#sec1 - in their FAQ you can see scholarships they offer
          * i sent them email about next steps for applying - i dont think i can continue anymore...until they respond
        * tokyo kogakuin japanese language school
          * 15 min walk from KitaSando station
    * [[2025-03-30]]
      * i feel startup visa is VERY unlikely...and i dont think i want my business incorporated in Japan, even tho it's ran there...so that prob makes even less likely to get the visa
      * path seems to be either Japanese Language School with Student Visa OR visa run and learn Japanese on my own...but i donttttt think i trust i will learn the language on my own

  * question
    * what would be cost of 1 year of study abroad in Tokyo?
      * Yamano Language School said cost per year total is: 2 million yen or $13.5k (covering all expenses for foreigner)
