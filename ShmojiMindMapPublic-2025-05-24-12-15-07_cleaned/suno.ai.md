  * tracking experiences with making songs
    * [[2024-09-21]]
      * for some reason it sucks at certain words like "lingering" and "physical" - it will just say random gibberish instead
      * for it to get the words and flow right, i think you need to capitalize new sentences and use newlines - which makes sense bc this is how many services intake lyrics too - like spotify
  * what is it?
    * as of 2023, you type lyrics and it generates like 15 secs of some random song with those lyrics. You can also choose a genre (or maybe not, think they workin on it)
  * questions
    * what does "get stems" do?
      * just splits into one vocals file and one instrumentals file
