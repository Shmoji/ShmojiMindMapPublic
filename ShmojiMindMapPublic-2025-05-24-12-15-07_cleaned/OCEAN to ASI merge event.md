  * key points
    * Starting with $FET as the base token of the Alliance, the $FET token will be renamed $ASI
    * an additional 1.48 Billion ASI tokens will be minted, with 867 million $ASI allocated to $AGIX holders and 611 million $ASI allocated to $OCEAN token holders - i guess this is the pool that is given to OCEAN holders after they convert from OCEAN to ASI? so not an airdrop
  * questions
    * what ahppens to the price of my tokens?
      * Bruce: price of FET (now ASI) * 0.433226 = price of your OCEAN (is this right?)
    * what is exchange rate for OCEAN to ASI?
      * fixed to 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN
    * what happens to my locked OCEAN tokens?
      * if teams vote YES:
        * i will immediately get airdropped "(1.25 ^ 4 - 1) * amountLocked" - this is around $15000 for me
        * then, your originally locked amount will be returned to you at time you originally set (so could be 4 years)
        * data farming stops forever
      * if NO:
        * data farming continues as usual
    * will i need to swap all my OCEAN to ASI
      * yes bc off exchange. But people with OCEAN on exchanges like Coinbase will not have to
        * note from team: Holders can choose to swap their tokens as soon as the token swap tool is available, or 10 years from now if they want to, at their leisure. The exchange rate will remain fixed. There is no rush.
