      * Yu Yu OVAs
        * There's 6 on CR, but all just recap episodes
        * There's one more OVA made in 2018 to cover bonus manga chapter called All or Nothing and Two Shots (basically 2 episodes)

        * [[2025-01-08]] 8/10 funny and good vibes, 5/10 other aspects of show, iz a fan service show to the core for sure, some cute romance vibes
          * it ended so abruptly i didnt even realize that was last episode and then last displayed episode was basically extras which extra confused me
          * many long story plots just left unfinished. like whole thing with husband guy forcing Yuzuki to complete training and temple inspection and come up with x money by some time

  * anime movies ive watched #[[movies, movie]] #[[movies with no or lil mapped info]] #anime #[[movies ive watched]]
    * SAO the Movie - Progressive - Aria of a Starless Night

      * Very girly because focuses on Asuna and female friend that was SAO beta tester. 
      * I don't think i really liked it. It changed things from season 1 that were just too different. Especially Kirito and Asuna's relationship. The fighting wasn't that great. Not much mystery. 
    * SAO: Ordinal Scale
      * 6/10
      * AR game. 
      * Augma AR devices are actually full dive machines. They defeat boss on floor 100 to make Kirito number 1 player and can kill all AR monsters. This stops all old SAO players from getting their memories stolen from death trauma and zapping memories away. 
    * SAO the Movie - Progressive - Scherzo of Deep Night
      * tracking my rating
        * [[2025-04-28]]

        * I watched sub

        * 4/10 if you've already seen show and don't like seeing same things again
        * basically recap of show with few tiny changes

          * [[2024-04-27]] 5-6/10 good fighting and filled some questions in lore, but aside from that not that great and kinda slow
        * story
          * tracking my thoughts
            * [[2024-04-26]]
              * oh shoot, that was Kei's bro that infitrated that weird religious group. I think to do so he had to get chip in brain that let's the God remote into his body by splitting his consciousness
              * was that woman professor Kei's gf's mom? if so shit - cuz Akira had to kill her. EDIT: yep! shittt. I guess Arata's dad ordered it too
              * Political leader Shindo is actually dad of Arata and he's an inspector in that sus org from S3
              * Shindo SR shoots self after Kei's wedding
              * so it seems Tonomi is main human bad guy leader, but everyone in Peacekeepers is loyal to the general which is an ai system of actual human brains like Sybil System
              * Akane kills current body of Sybil on stage at end. She is then locked somewhere
              * Kogami promises to get her out
