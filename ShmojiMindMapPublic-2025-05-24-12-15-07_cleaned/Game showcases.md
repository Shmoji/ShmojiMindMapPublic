      * First day is called ONL Opening Night Live
    * past
      * happened around end of August in 2023. Happened in Germany. Geoff apparently said largest game showcase (not sure about that tho). After ONL, there have been 2 game showcases. One was indie showcase which was hour long and amazing. Aside from that livestream has been a lot of talking from prerecorded videos from the event. I guess they only actually take it live at certain times (not noted with a schedule).
