            * Biting alien

          * Plot

            * Weird item is puzzle. When solved a knife comes out. If it cuts you, aliens take you and brutally kill you
        * CATEGORY: scary in "this could be real" way
          * Annihilation ^gfF-CcvO6
            * old notes from Evernote
              * Natalie Portman as Lena
              * Meteorite hits and creates barrier around lighthouse that keeps growing. Inside is called the shimmer
              * Lena's husband Kane went into the shimmer and was the first to come out, but he was all weird
              * So, Lena goes into the shimmer with a team.
              * Inside, all DNA flows like light and everything is mutating
              * Prob the hardest part to watch: they find film of Kane cutting open friends stomach and you see giant shit moving around in his stomach
              * Huge bear/possum gets Cass Shepherd. The part of her afraid and dying mutated with the bear. You see it later and the bear's voice is Shepherd's screaming help me.
              * Josie Radek turns into flower basically, she accepts it.
              * In lighthouse, thing goes inside Dr Ventress, then she turns into light bubbles basically. Those form into something that Lena looks into with wonder. Then, it turns human shaped and metal-looking. She runs and bumps into another that mimics everything she does. It turns into her as she hands it grenade. Blows up and kills everything with fire.
              * Think it was legit just alien life mutating shit in a realistic way. It had no intentions, it was just a form of life.
