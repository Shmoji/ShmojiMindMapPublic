  * Notes
    * Achieving desires
      * what to do when stuck on achieving a desire?
        * List out your current plans/options/what you know
        * List out exactly what is blocking you
        * Send the desire with the 2 above info to LLM and get hopefully useful response back.
          * If not useful, then repeat the above. If all else, need to make decision/action or learn more.
      * Action-plan mind-state for me
        * Dont act on complex desires, only simple desires. Complex desires are meant to be a persisted mind-state. But they do need to be re-evaluated too.
      * My thoughts
        * It seems like to achieve any desire with many unknowns, you need to learn something. However, sometimes you have to practice/experience something before you can learn the thing. Just understanding isn't always enough (depends on # of unknowns) - need practice beforehand.
        * Some desires don't require learning. Just takes practice/experience/action. For example, desire to eat (already understand how to do). Desire to complete task you completely understand how to do, maybe at work. I think the consistent thing for all these desires that don't require learning is that you already know/understand how to achieve the desire.
    * Random thoughts
      * Anytime a tool is needed to help achieve goal or desire, it is almost always because there is a lot of unknowns. People trying to act on complex desires. Best method to help these people is to help them LEARN or to get them to take ACTION if they already understand.
