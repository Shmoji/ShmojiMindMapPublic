        * neuro game dev on YT: [[Neurosity Crown BCI headset]] is super hard to integrate into Unity, so didnt like it. The Muse works super well though, despite not tracking as well.
        * he also says you cannot get around fact that each function in a game requires 30 minutes or more of training that command/function. Which is not plug and play - which is why he doesnt like the crown
          * his comment: With the Neurosity Crown, those are the only two metrics I get out of the box without having to train the computer to recognize other ideas/feelings/inputs, which can take some time to setup and require an entire tutorial sequence for each brain pattern being trained. I could also get the raw brainwaves but, since I am not a Data Scientist/Neurologist, I cannot really do much with them. Calm/Focus are just the path of least resistance towards a Minimum Viable Product (he built little demo using calm/focus)
