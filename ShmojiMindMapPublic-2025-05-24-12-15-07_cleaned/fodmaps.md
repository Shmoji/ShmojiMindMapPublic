  * tracking learning what FODMAPs are
    * [[2024-11-05]] my learnings on FODMAPs in 2023, new learnings now, use meme-symbols to recall #[[fast memo]]
      * 2023 learnings during my SIBO arc
        * stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides and Polyols.
        * Simply put, (in terms of SIBO) these are the “fuel” for the bacteria/yeast which have over populated.  They are small chain fermentable carbohydrates.  The bacteria feed off of these quickly fermented carbohydrates and malabsorbed sugars, resulting in bloating, gas, and pain
      * FODMAPs are specific types of short-chain carbohydrates that some people have difficulty digesting - which then can lead to those carbs being fermented instead...excessively...causing gas byproducts that cause inflammation/bloating/reflux/etc
      * Q: i think of carbs as sugars, is this too narrow definition?
        * Technically right. But includes simple sugars/monosaccharides (like glucose and fructose) to complex forms/sugar/carbs (like starch and fiber)
        * These complex carbs don’t taste sweet, so calling all carbs "sugars" might be misleading since it skips over the structure and function of more complex carbs...which arent sweet
        * Q: are Disaccharides sweet? are Oligosaccharides sweet?
          * **Disaccharides** are generally sweet (though varying in intensity)
          * **Oligosaccharides** are typically not sweet (less sweet bc more complex/high-quantity bonded chain)
          * the minimal sweetness in 100% dark choco comes from very small amount of simple sugars
          * Q: are simple sugars just monosaccharides or also disacch and oligosacch?
            * ss are mono and di, but not oligo bc ss are generally 1) sweet 2) easily absorbed by body without much digestion
      * Q: are there carbs that are not FODMAPs? A: yes lol
      * me: it seems categories of FODMAPs honestly not too accurate - you really would just need to research each piece of food independently to know
      * Q: i know of simple sugars/monosaccharides and complex sugars/polysaccharides, but what are Oligosaccharides and Disaccharides
        * Oligosaccharides and disaccharides are two intermediate forms of carbohydrates that sit between simple monosaccharides and complex polysaccharides (based on number of bonded monosaccharide molecules)
        * ### **Disaccharides**
          * **Definition**: Disaccharides are carbohydrates made of **two monosaccharide molecules** bonded together.
          * **Examples**:
            * **Sucrose** (table sugar) = glucose + fructose
            * **Lactose** (milk sugar) = glucose + galactose
            * **Maltose** (malt sugar) = glucose + glucose
          * **Digestion**: Disaccharides need to be broken down by enzymes in the small intestine into their monosaccharide components before they can be absorbed. For example, lactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose. If someone lacks this enzyme, lactose remains undigested, leading to the digestive issues associated with lactose intolerance - bc dey ferment like crazyyy causing gas byproducts like crazyyy
          * **FODMAP Relevance**: Lactose is the main FODMAP disaccharide because it can be poorly absorbed by people with lactose intolerance.
        * ### **Oligosaccharides**
          * **Definition**: Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates made of **a small chain of three to ten monosaccharide units**. They’re more complex than disaccharides but shorter than polysaccharides (starch, fiber, glycogen)
          * **Examples**:
            * **Fructans**: Chains of fructose molecules, often found in foods like wheat, onions, garlic, and rye. meme: fruct eating these raw
            * **Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)**: Chains of galactose units, commonly found in legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas). meme: bc beans wtf - are out of this galaxy
          * **Digestion**: ALL humans lack the enzymes to break down ALL oligosaccharides in the small intestine. Instead, these carbs pass into the large intestine, where gut bacteria ferment them, producing gas and other byproducts. The reason healthy people dont have problems with oligobois is bc same reasons i learned most people dont get fermentation of banana they ate (about gas production from fermentation. related: 1) numBacteria, 2) kindOfBacteria, 3) tooSlowMotility, 4) lackingEnzymes. Healthy ppl all gud here)
          * **FODMAP Relevance**: Fructans and GOS are major FODMAP oligosaccharides. They’re known to cause digestive issues for some people, especially those with IBS, because of their fermentable nature.
        * WOAH: **Polysaccharides**: Contain **hundreds to thousands of monosaccharide units**. Also, MOST (but not all like certain fiber) are digestible despite having more monosaccharides than oligobois. So sweetness linear with complexity of chain (mostly), but not digestibility
      * meh maybe ill take notes on polyols one day...but for now...naaa
      * seems main bad fodmap monosaccharide is FRUCTOSE bc 4 some ppl iz poorly absorbed in small intestine and then goes get fermented. Apparently the ratio of glucose to fructose is important bc glucose helps fructose to be absorbed...but if those glucose aint there...no bueno
      * just some context: carbs are mostly about energy storage and transfer/work (physical). PROTEINS are about structure, enzymes, biological functions, signaling (analog/math/mechanical) - altho this isnt totally the case, will memo elsewhere
  * diets related to SIBO
    * SCD (specific carbohydrate diet)
      * SCD aims to reduce inflammation in the gut by eliminating foods that are difficult to digest. The diet focuses on consuming foods that are easy to digest, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.
    * Low FODMAP diet - obv what it is
    * SIBO Specific Diet ^yg_SVEtbg
      * This diet, designed by Dr. Allison Siebecker, combines the low FODMAPs and SCD diets.
