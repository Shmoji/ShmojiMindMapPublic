    * previously i thought turmeric tea caused pain in upper-left gums. Then, it kept happening. I cut out 1) water from water filter and 2) drinking pill insides of trace minerals - after that, i think the pain is completely gone. I wonder which was real culprit. I think im going to reintroduce turmeric and see what happens
