  * Experiments

    * [ ] next time overwhelmed, instead of trying to CONQUER the feeling, try to increase the number of active challenges
      * explanation of this challenge: [[feeling overwhelmed]]
      * results
        * yea idk, seems like most of the time i feel physically tired, which is similar to overwhelmed - but increasing any energy in any way just makes me more tired, so taking on more active challenges doesnt help
    * [ ] Try better observing the list of things you are actively trying to control in each moment. Make note of it
      * results
        * i try to control my voice and even have to a bit. it's VERY often that i observe the physical feelings of talking when in middle of talking. As those physical feelings hurt more, i observe my anxiety increase bc 1) other people may misinterpret what im saying due to pain voice altering how it's output 2) sound of voice may sound unpleasant 3) blaming self for bad voice and pain
    * [x] Try spending 1 entire day with no thought. If thought arises, then try to stop it

      * Results

        * i think i prefer this. it doesn't make bad feels much better, but it makes most moments less clogged with info. Lil bit more clarity
        * pretty sure i learned that the long form thoughts have been limiting me by clogging my mind with unnecessary information. For example, I'll already understand some sentence i just read, but my mind is still reading it in English in my head - waste of energy
        * Pretty sure as i get more exhausted as day goes on, it is not due to overload of info from the external world. I think it is actually overload of info looping in the mind unintentionally. Maybe my mind's garbage collection function is broke lol

  * Experiments with improvement of issues in life

    * [ ] Try using positive deviance as i defined in [[Vocab - words - terms]]. Easiest method is to experiment using speedrunning BKGR. I really want to figure out how to experiment with this for talking in groups when all attention is on me
