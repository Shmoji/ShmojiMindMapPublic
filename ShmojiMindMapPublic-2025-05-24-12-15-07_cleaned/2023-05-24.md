    * i have hypothesis that issues with gums are due to turmeric in UltraNutrient or something else in one of these supps. So, im switching UltraNutret with TraceMinerals for now. Gonna observe if gums finally get better. I had this idea bc last time gums got bad was at dad's randomly. Know what i drink there? Turmeric tea ^Fkbe_lqGe
    * Felt a good bit poo poo this morning. Bit of muscle weakness and moderate sinus pain. Just after eating lunch didnt feel better. 2 hours later i went on walk in sun and just after that i did indeed feel much better and i have no idea why. Could just be due to sun. I felt a mental shift when i walked into sun too. I realized how good the moment is. The infinite time mindset. It was like a millisecond thought, but thought id mention it.
