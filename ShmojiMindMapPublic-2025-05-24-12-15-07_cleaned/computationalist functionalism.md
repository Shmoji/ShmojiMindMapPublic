  * what is computationalist functionalism? #[[fast memo]] ^m4TiKPGys
    * joscha bach:
      * functionalism: you observe behavior of some object, generate model of that object based on observed behavior, there is no hidden essence you have access to - just observed behavior. Very hard to defeat idea that you can know objects directly NOT through their observed behavior.
      * computationalism: position about representation. Can represent anything with state transitions. 
      * combo of both
      * EDIT: so i guess states are models of observed behavior/function of a thing and combining these states together is used to represent a thing
