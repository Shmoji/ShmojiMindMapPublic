        * cjetty26 paraphrased: "we used to say runner's high is due to "endorphins" but later ppl said endorphins dont cross blood brain barrier and [[anandamide, AEA]] (a cannabinoid) is the true cause. ive been experimenting with 2+ hour cardio and can confirm i get stoned around 2H mark consistently if no cannabis tolerance"
        * stewartalsopiii: "he learned anandamide is related to dancing which makes sense to him how similar state is to weed once in the flow"

    * The function of endorphins can be stated in general terms as well as broken down specifically and observed per each endorphin type. In general, the release of endorphins is understood to be associated with the body’s response to pain and also exercise as associated with “runner’s high.” The pain relief experienced as a result of the release of endorphins has been determined to be greater than that of morphine. Additionally, endorphins have been found to be associated with states of pleasure including such emotions brought upon by laughter, love, sex, and even appetizing food
