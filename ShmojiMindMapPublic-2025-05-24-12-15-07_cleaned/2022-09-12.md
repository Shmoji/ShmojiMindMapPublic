    * Saw Lisa Oskardmay at Acupractic Natural Healing Center. Told her all my issues. She said my water path definitely seems to be funky since kidney issues and that path goes up to sinuses/nose and that's relevant. Just did acupressure today. Next time will do acupuncture in Japanese style. She says that style does not hurt.
    * Today i started probiotic 2/day instead of just once per day. I guess ill stop once i meet with doc again on 23rd of this month

    * When i try to put arm behind back and up towards top of head, the left one easily goes up high. The right arm struggles to go high. Feel pressure in shoulder and shoulder blade
