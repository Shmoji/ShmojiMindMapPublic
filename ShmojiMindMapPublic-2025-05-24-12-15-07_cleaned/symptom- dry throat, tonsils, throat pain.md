Wonder if related to gum issue coming back. Havent had dry painful throat in long time. Last memory is gurgling salt water at dads. My assumption is this symptom somehow triggered at dads but idk why. EDIT: i sneezed and felt the pain on jaw floor off to sides - maybe that is tonsils?]]

      * happened to me today right after eating salmon, fried okra, and peaches at the boat house
  * tracking throat pain specifically that feels like pain in tonsils
    * [[2024-11-29]]
      * ate sotanghon and for last few days after that, pain in throat - especially in tonsils areas - is about 4-6/10 pain
      * my best guess is it is caused by garlic somehow
      * only other guess is 2nd hand smoke caused this, but i doubt it
      * i even had dream of some sort of white masses in tonsil areas of my mouth - may be brain pattern matching to fungal infection thing i read about with person in hospital
    * [[2024-12-13]]
      * at dinner yesterday ate stuff like pikadillio but without tomato sauce. Beef, soy sauce, potatoes, white rice, GARLIC (found out later). Then, i had some fritos which have ingredients: corn, vegetable oil, salt. After eating all dis i got 4-5/10 tonsil-area pain that radiated to sinuses under eyes. No idea if from pikadilio or from fritos
      * my guess: not fritos.
      * well shoot, maybe it iz garlic then. if not: gotta be soy sauce, potatoes, or beef
      * but the other day i had some meal with garlic dissolved into sauce and it didnt seem to cause any trouble..i think
    * [[2024-12-16]]
      * noticed it like 3-4/10 after lunch time. only food i ate: 1) brown rice, broccoli, mackerel, peanut butter crackers. Day before i had potato soup for dinner (likely has flour and onion in it)
    * [[2024-12-26]]
      * after eating lunch of Christmas even i had like 7/10 pain rest of day. My guess is caused by chocolate stuff Sarah made. Chocolate was mainly just cane sugar (which is mainly just sucrose) and cocoa butter. Dont think choco is the issue. She also used: califia farms heavy whipping cream (coconut oil, sunflower oil, fava bean protein isolate, acacia, natural flavor, xanthan gum, gellan gum) AND earth balance butter (a bunch of seed oils and some other stuff you can just lookup)
      * it also gave me nightmares that night and common pulsing in ears
      * ideas of cause: 1) just too much sugar does that to me 2) seed oils 3) i did eat good bit of cheese (2 diff kinds)...so maybe the mold of the cheese is issue OR certain amount of CALCIUM is issue
      * i feel it's the sugary foods...but is it just when i have too much sugar or is it specific ingredient??
