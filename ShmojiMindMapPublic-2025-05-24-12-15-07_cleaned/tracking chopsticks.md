      * watched many videos trying to teach me how to use chopsticks, none really worked
      * every method hurts multiple spots on my hand
      * the main proper method causes lots of pain and bottom stick always slides off ring finger towards crevice between fingers
      * improper method of holding bottom stick from above with middle finger seems to do me the best
