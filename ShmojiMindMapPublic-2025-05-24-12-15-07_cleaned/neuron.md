      * Looks like thick button at end of axon
      * The axon terminal is half of a synapse.
      * A synapse is the connecting structure between two neurons. It includes the axon terminal (the “presynaptic bouton”), the synaptic cleft (a tiny gap), and the dendritic terminal or dendritic spine (the “postsynaptic bouton”).
      * The presynaptic side releases **neurotransmitters** into the synaptic cleft and the postsynaptic side senses it with **neuroreceptors**. Both sides working together transmit the signal from one neuron to the next. (This is in the case of a chemical synapse)
      * Axon terminals are one potential point of alteration when the brain changes via **neural plasticity**. If additional neurotransmitters are released, or if new synaptic connections are made with other neurons, brain change occurs, and this change may reflect something as basic as learning a simple fact or undergoing a simple experience. ^S3Mimwqxk
    * synapse
      * Small junction connecting neurons that includes axon terminal of one neuron and the dendrite of another (read axon terminal to understand)
      * Neurochemicals are exchanged here. Some of these neurochemicals trigger the next cell to ‘fire’ as well, while some contribute to the long-term interconnectedness of the two neurons.
      * Chemical synapse has a gap, exhanges neurotransmitters (fill in more here)
      * Electrical synapse has no gap, is connected by an ion channel, is smaller, faster, (fill in more here)
