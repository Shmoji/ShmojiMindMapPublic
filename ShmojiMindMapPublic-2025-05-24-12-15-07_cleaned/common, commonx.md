    * tracking my user experience of common
      * [[2023-11-19]]
        * met with Matan Field and resonating like a mofo. He's creating almost same thing as me just slightly different
        * the UX seems most focused on chatting at the moment. Roam and Notion is for slow moving personal symbol communication - Common is focused on fast moving collaborative symbol communication
        * thing he said i resonated with innovation of this tech isnt the web3 underlying, but that does enable the innovation in many other ways.

  * what is common
    * mindmapping and collaboration on everything, at least that's the goal. Currently it seems to be more of categorizing/organizing convos. So you can conversate on any "node" and it branches down infinitely in any direction
  * what is commonX
    * the open corp creating common
  * features
    * Discussions
      * These are collaborative chats with other people on any "node" - but are leaves/end-states in the sense that no nesting can happen under them
      * I suppose you could just create Space if you need to nest convos - not sure if that switch from Discussion to Space causes any issues tho
    * Spaces
      * these are "nodes" that can be created infinitely down at any level - but are not "Commons" - but Commons are spaces
      *  for each space there's a Home stream by default.
    * Commons
      * i think these are the most top level "nodes". They are a type of space
    * Streams
      * The leaves of the graph
      * I think they are a category for leaves of graph. Discussions are type of stream. So are proposals.
  * questions
    * can you be member of a Space without being member of the parent Common?
      * No, in roadmap tho
    * is it possible to have private common yet? what about public common with both private and public spaces?
      * No, in roadmap tho
    * if i wanted to think of this as a KMA like logseq, how would i go about mapping symbols?
      * Feels like it makes you make the decision in beginning whether the thing you create is a Space or a Stream - so infinite branch OR a leaf
