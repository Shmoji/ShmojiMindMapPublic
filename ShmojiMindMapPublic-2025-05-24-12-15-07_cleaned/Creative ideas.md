  * Vulnerable ideas
    * at our worst
      * Maybe 2 people get together when one or both are at a low point and then just talk on camera
    * build our relationship
      * there is a thing - an object - that can be interacted with and built. This thing is a relationship.
      * For MVP, just relationship between 2 people maybe.
  * Fun ideation and predicting the future
    * [[hypotheticals project]]
  * Teaching / tutorials
    * Create educational content specifically for VR and 3D environments
  * 3D Virtual World
    * Connecting 3D to 2D
      * The chat for 3D world can be seen like discord chat or be seen in 3D world. Chats are permanent history. For example, have a 3D world for my Discord. Maybe special chat only for 3D worlders.
        * i think Second Life and VR chat do this.
    * Viewing data of self (like desires) in 3D
      * Watch trailer for Where Thoughts Go VR and youll see what i mean
    * Giving data life ^dxMYrxNxy
      * like the idea above, people can give life to ANY data. Maybe by adding voice or telling a story, etc.
  * Fun ideas

    * Old learning commands game. User maybe starts with few known words and then has to unlock every other word. The more unlocked, the more options become available in game. The could unlock "fly" and then use it to fly. 
    * Create beautiful things on web pages. For example, take image from midjourney and create it on frontend.
    * Create frontend where user enters input, then AI converts input by creating dynamic variable. This is sent to backend where it's stored in 1 table in backend. Maybe AI is used here to store data and create APIs?

  * Small ideas

    * User enters whatever info about themself and then GPT will tell them if they are INFP, what Potter house, etc
  * ChatGPT plugin ideas

    * send hugs and more socially through chatbot
      * Shmoji hugged Johmsi at 1:33 on x date
      * There is list of things that can be done vetted by me
        * hug
        * head pat
        * poke
        * gm
      * User perspective
        * user wants to send
          * send hug to Johmsi
        * user wants to receive or check if they received
          * do i have any new notifications/hugs/etc?
    * Fun plugin

      * Maybe fun game through chat.
      * [ ] start setting up API and more more fun plugin
        * good inspiration: https://www.geekmetaverse.com/24-best-games-you-can-play-with-chatgpt/
          * funAI: i imagine UI where user can choose game/fun-thing, choose different UIs (maybe there is default), and then play game
  * GPT and AI ideas

    * ChatGPT profile. Tell ChatGPT everything about YOU. Then, this will always be at beginning of prompt sent to GPT and questions can be asked. Named idea: WhoAmI
    * App where users talk with GPT and it tracks what they say they want and their questions. Wants will be shown in list and can be sorted for what's most important. Same for questions and can mark if you found satisfactory answer
      * Idea related: generate metadata tags to define YOU using GPT. So user makes decision to generate this metadata. Then, they can decide to sell it. Not sure how that part would work though.
    * Service that pulls twitter timeline of data using twitter API and then will use GPT to add tags to all that user's content and display it in useful way for them. This idea came because i was wondering how i can combine twitter API and GPT API into business idea.
    * Discord app like Zulip. Create bot that turns certain contexts into topics. That way people can easily keep up with huge chat where they can't go back and read everything. 
    * Chatbot stores every word in language you're learning down. Stores your confidence in ability to recall word. Can do same with phrases. AI can use this knowledge to give you just the right convos to help you learn quickly. ^zNsL1RIq3
      * Prompt building
        * what i want in response
          * MAYBE: breakdown mapping words used in sentence to words (or grammar) in list
        * the prompt...so far
          * here's all Japanese words i know. I only know them in kana, not in Kanji:
          * わたし (i)
          * ぼく (i)
          * 私たち (we)
          * くるま (car)
          * あなた (you)
          * ともだち (friend)
          * いく (to go)
          * ある (to exist)
          * する (to do)
          * いる (to be (animate))
          * なる (to become)
          * くる (to come)
          * もう (already)
          * こと (thing)
          * かんがえる (to think)
          * とき (time)
          * みる (to see)
          * だけ (only)
          * あいだ (between)
          * まだ (yet, still)
          * おおい (many)
          * そう (seems, looks like)
          * あかるい (bright)
          * きく (to hear)
          * おもい (heavy)
          * たいへん (difficult)
          * おきる (to wake up)
          * かう (to buy)
          * かえる (to return)
          * とおい (far)
          * あたらしい (new)
          * しずか (quiet)
          * I only know those forms of the words and no other forms.
          * I know the grammar for: は, が, を, に, and で. I know the grammar for asking questions using か. I kind of understand the よ particle.
          * Know that i am trying to learn Japanese using your responses. It's up to you if you decide to do anything with that knowledge.
          * Everytime you receive a prompt from me, can you return 1 Japanese sentence that a 5 year old could understand using only these words? So basically we'll conversate in Japanese, but you only respond one Japanese sentence at a time in every way explained.
          * For each Japanese sentence, can you also translate it to kana.
          * Feel free to add as much English as you need to explain things. That doesn't count towards the one Japanese sentence.
          * If i make any mistakes in my Japanese, feel free to simply correct me - but dont go too overboard focusing on that.
      * brainstorming
        * User can choose to study using only words already know (recap) or choose to add 1, 2, or more new words.
        * User can rate words
        * User can rate sentences (maybe user can rate words of a sentence in relations to a sentence)
        * Before user starts learning, for AI, they need to give:
          * Note: need way to skip past doing these if waste of time for user (autofill?)
          * Whether they know hiragana and katakana
          * all grammar they know
          * All forms of each word they know. Otherwise it will give them a word they know in form they dont know and they wont know it
        * For prompt to work in japanese, user needs to rate:
          * All grammar they know (wa, ga, yo,)
        * Random thoughts to keep in mind

          * Make this in 3D world since that will be future 
      * how TOs
        * how to make it fun continuously
          * make it a chatbot for convos. Convos are fun.
      * Similar ideas
        * Looks like Quizlet may be doing this with Q-Chat

    * Use GPT as therapist. It listens to input and asks if it understood correctly. User needs to keep explaining if AI understood correctly or not. Once understood, AI gives options.
    * AI Sucks - create tech that looks just like ChatGPT, but is human behind the scenes. The key point: you go here when ai cant solve your issue and a human solves it instead
  * Data ideas

  * OCEAN ideas / DataUnions
    * Build tech that bridges people's data from ANY note-taking app to be privately sold in data union
    * Tech that identifies data as insight data or straight up data
    * Tech that takes a data service and shows data you input and insights that come from data. This makes sure that user is okay with the insights being produced from their data before giving any.
    * Tech that takes any data and identifies it with someone if it is public data
    * People make clips from video games and they are posted onto OCEAN

      * Questions
        * Would this be good for a DataUnion? Video game data union?
    * Way to convert dataset from one format to another. Imagine you are solo person and you post all your health data just on its own. No one works well with your data format. So if you could convert to format of other data unions, that'd be super valuable.
  * YouTube vids
    * Title: Example of GOD using a computer program

      * Show hidden data changing and whatnot without user knowing
    * Title: how can a human create an interface to God?
  * Gaming
    * Decentralized achievements. I found myself no longer caring about 100% switch games because idek if they are stored at an account level and even if they are, they can only be viewed on switch. If they were stored centrally for all consoles/games, i would love that shit
      * Examples of this already being done
        * https://www.exophase.com/ - seems more devs, but maybe more corporate
        * https://www.playtracker.net/ - less or one dev, but less corporate
        * https://metagamerscore.com/ - maybe dead based on no twitter activity??
    * speedrun on chain or decentralized network
    * OH SHIT - create that OG game from FOREVER ago as GPT PLUGIN
      * user has to create their universe. Any word they enter cant be used until they learn it
      * this can be the start of the Shmoji Universe!!!
    * Create algorithm to PROVE person X completed achievement X. So, a computation that can be sold on Ocean - for every single achievement in a game (or outside a game)
    * Wordle extension where you can save your end-states as NFTs to look back on later ^ebJeisMh2
  * No category
    * Gamified life coaching
      * You open website and it asks if you want the gamified version (not fast, but fun) or quick coaching (fast, but less fun). User creates account. In game, they are prompted to enter life issues and learn how to start making progress on them in fun way. 
  * Websites that allow users to create a list
    * A list of all unknowns of human knowledge
    * A list of all desires of humans
    * A list of all experiences of humans (i think this can cover every single other list idea with correct formatting)

    * mechanics
      * walk in room with meta glasses, see paint app open with panels partially finished but all text of story there. give enough time to read and that's it for video. AORT
  * social + useful ideas
    * specific intent to recall using topics in social setting
      * idea: app where you have as many topics as possible and you can conversate on each topic WITH REAL PEOPLE with specific intent of RECALLING info of that topic. thinking about how many different things i never get to talk about - some being pretty important
      * although, an issue i could see is most people just becoming lurkers - and it's the act of participating that helps with recall the most
      * maybe some mechanism in the app to encourage people to say at least one thing on their mind related to the topic when they visit - BUT it doesnt have to be in the flow of some previous or ongoing conversation (that's often what prevents me from participating in important/relevant/resonating topics)
