  * what it is?
    * wolfram: how we determine the output at each node from the weighted sum of inputs
    * me: seems like a fx that is a black box
  * what it do?
    * adds non-linear-ness to (input:output) pair. It was linear, but then activation fx says hell na
  * in terms of brain
    * the non-linear interactions (activation fxs) within the brain give rise to the phenomenon of subjective experience. I think bc the non-linear-ness creates a self that is executing separately from (input:output). But not really, i think it's executing still on material surface - but it's executing with much more compute than say a rock (it's executing with similar compute to the universe itself)
    * activation fxs maybe allow the material universe to break free of time...or something like that...im just spitballin. Bc then it has memory and can compute solely on that memory and combine new input with old memory
  * in terms of artificial NN
    * the non-linear interactions (activation fxs) enables the network to learn and represent non-linear relationships in the data, making it capable of solving complex tasks that would be impossible for a purely linear model
  * questions
    * is it right to think of activation function like a brain? like a self? idk
