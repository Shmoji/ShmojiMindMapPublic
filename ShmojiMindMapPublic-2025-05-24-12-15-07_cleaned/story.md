  * what is it?
    * a co-creator of reality (other creator is us conscious people)
    * it is living or dead depending on how people perceive it
    * made of 3 essential qualities:
      * [[truth]]
        * cold expression of beauty
        * what coherence/beauty looks like from the outside
        * known through thought
        * relative
      * goodness
        * warm expression of beauty
        * what coherence/beauty feels like from the inside
        * known through feeling
        * absolute
      * [[beauty]] / coherence
      * these 3 concepts cannot be separated and beauty is the most fundamental. 
  * what do they do?
    * they are the divine mediator (conflict resolver) of relationships. Does your relationship with thing x treat it like a dead thing to be used or like a living being worth of service and protection?
    * they steer the process of creation itself (thanks to most important relationship they mediate talked about below)
    * a story manifests as [[vision]] to the degree to which its [[truth]] is in service to its goodness because through its context with goodness relative truth becomes absolute - emerging from the right relationship of masculine and feminine - which will always be experienced as a deepening of beauty (not sure i get this). Since cold beauty is in service to warm beauty, this will be experienced as the vision as a whole feeling warm. Another way to say: a vision will feel coherent from the inside as much as it looks coherent from the outside. 
  * different minds interacting with story
    * liminal mind
      * when LM interacts with story, it encounters it as a vision. Proportional to its degree of beauty, a vision will inspire or literally incarnate its spirit into liminal mind. It will do so with many LM who together will then conspire (breathe together) into a [[culture]] or social organism. Lastly, this culture will come up with strategy (DEAD/tool) for manifesting that vision in reality.
      * So, LM serves vision as culture with strategy. Flowing from inspiration through conspiration to manifestation. Vision dictates what manifests as reality. Vision is what story becomes when perceived on basis of love. Vision is infused with love, which in turn will infuse reality with love manifesting as increase in beauty. More love in reality invites more LM which will perceive more story as vision and cycle continues. Can call this the autopoiesis of love OR self-perpetuation of love
    * domesticated mind
      * when DM interacts with story, it encounters it as narrative. Starts from place of fear and without freedom, fear always demands control. DM starts thinking about strategy for control. As part of strategy, it finds others who are also afraid and seek control. Together they also conspire, but this time into a [[cult]] rather than a culture. The nature of their cooperation relies on prisoner's dilemma type of basis - meaning it consists solely of the functional reason that together they will be more effective in reaching their common goal for control.
      * As a cult, they engineer a narrative aimed at manipulating whoever holds it into acting out the hidden agenda of the cult which is always aimed at increasing control of the in-group over the out-group. This constitutes the heart of the social machine.
      * So, DM serves strategy as cult with narrative. Also a cycle, but of fear. The Autopoiesis of fear
  * key points
    * most important relationship story mediates is one between potentiality (what could be) and actuality (what is). This is why you can predict the future through story
