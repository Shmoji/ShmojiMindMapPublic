          * experimenting with time to finish based on weight

            * Try 1: if you eat 1-2 small break-off pieces every day one time, it can last about 5-7 days as snack. This based on experiment with 0.39 lb piece
            * Try 2: lasted about 4-5 days for 0.4 lb piece. 2 times i got pieces bigger than i wanted.
            * I'd say this is amount of time/enjoyment of this food is totally worth the cost. About $7 lasting you about 5 days in snacks.

            * try 1
              * have ate 3 times so far and each times was good amount and v satisfying. Like anything that is basically a drink, you can drink it pretty quick, but still lasts a decent time during consumption process.
              * SUMMARY: seems the consuming time is not as long as Goat Yogurt, but you get to enjoy it multiple more times before running out (which also saves money)
                * i remember snacking on Yogurt while watching show for long time. Whereas with kefir i usually drink in a minute or so.
