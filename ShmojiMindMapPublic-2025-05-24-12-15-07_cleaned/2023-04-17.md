  * [[creator journal, creative, tracking]]
    * i should totally find ways to connect my objective research self with edgy self. like a video like: "its 3am and youre wondering how ai may help you cure your depression"
    * when creating video on open source AI versus closed source AI, i made a crucial pivot that i often cant make. I recorded the video the first time and it sucked, was boring, and long. The 2nd try was pretty darn good and felt good to create. I will write down how i did it here:
      * i went too in detail in the first one. No one wanted to hear about the pros and cons i wrote down for my self debate
      * after that 1st try, i wrote down the key points and followed the key points closely when creating new video
      * i also decided to write it like a story from my perspective and this felt more creative and nice. It's like i was telling the story of my process rather than trying to objectively put concepts out there. Transformed from a boring analysis to a creative journey of science. I still dont completely understand, but it worked

    * Traded out Meowscarada's Night Slash for Knock Off. If enemy has no item, only slightly less damage. If have item, it removes it and does like 50% more damage woah! Dark type move.
