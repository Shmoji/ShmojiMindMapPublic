      * Simply fill a bowl with cold tap water and place your eggs in it. If they sink to the bottom and lay flat on one side, they are fresh and good to eat. A bad egg will float because of the large air cell that forms at its base. Any floating eggs should be thrown out.

  * questions
    * Why did egg have white dusty stuff on it after finished boiling?
      * CALCIUM CARBONATE: The white dusty stuff you observed on the boiled egg is called "calcium carbonate." It's a natural compound found in eggshells and can sometimes become more noticeable after boiling due to the water removing some of the outer layers of the shell. It's harmless and can be easily wiped off or rinsed away.
