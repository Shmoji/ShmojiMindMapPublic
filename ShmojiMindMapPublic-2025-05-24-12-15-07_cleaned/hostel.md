  * what is hostel? #[[fast memo]] ^ygI1uOr1K
    * like hotel except coliving space. like one room with bunch of bunks. MUCH CHEAPER than hotel - often like 10USD/day. BUT, kinda scary in terms of ur stuff getting stolen imo. BUT if good place, would be good social experience
    * often has other paid services like washing clothes, shower, locker
