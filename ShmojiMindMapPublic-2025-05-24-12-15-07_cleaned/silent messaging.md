  * tracking thoughts on what it is

      * im noticing it's not really silent messaging or telepathy that is super useful for me - it seems just having very subtle signals that typically go unheard - be heard - is what is useful
      * i guess this is my realization that "silent messaging" can be interpreted as telepathy OR as communicating subtle signals...which is confusing hmmm
