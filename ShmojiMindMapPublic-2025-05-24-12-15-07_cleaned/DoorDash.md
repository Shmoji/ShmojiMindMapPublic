  * Pay

    * DD pays about $2 per order. 
    * DD pay is based on tips. Tipper should tip about $1.25 per mile. That is good and $2 is great 
  * Scheduling

    * If you schedule ahead of time, you get guaranteed work. If you don't schedule ahead, there's no guarantee you get work unless it's very busy. And if you do get work like this, it'll be not a lot

    * They release work many days prior and you can take as many hours as you want if you are early
