  * my consistent patterns
    * find myself doing nothing except pondering on what to do next but cant decide on what to do next. i want to do what is best for my mood or just do something i wanna do, but no options match these. typically in this state - i see various options and all of them i feel STRONGLY and physically that i dont want to do any of those options.
    * MUSIC: using background music to help me focus and get working on some task ^qPDOmxxun
    * MINIMAL SOCIAL PRESENCE: using a background twitch stream to help me focus in a laid back way that may or may not be productive, but still get working on a task ^KNXPnWqCc
    * feeling i need to rush on task at hand so i can do something else afterwards...even if there is nothing happening after
    * CATEGORY: social
      * feeling i need to rush whatever im saying bc i feel my input is always getting in the way of the other person/group
  * related
