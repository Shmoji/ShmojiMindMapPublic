  * tracking thoughts on what it is
    * [[2024-04-26]]
      * a research project trying all kinds of things - not just one product or idea
      * they are focused on version control (imagine git process) but in terms of any data - maybe focused a lot on editing text docs tho
      * seems automerge tool is key to building these cool research projects and also this research is what motivates to continue improving automerge
      * seems automerge can be used with any data, not just text docs - in their research they used diagrams on tldraw and they used spreadsheets and worked fine thanks to automerge
  * what is it?
    * Patchwork is a research project from Ink and Switch about universal version control software AT STORAGE LAYER OF YOUR OS for writers, developers, and other creatives.
