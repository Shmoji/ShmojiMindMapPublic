      * dude named Fram with tons of edits got year long ban. Typically bans come from panel of editors empowered to make such decisions called English Wikipedia Arbitration Committee (Arbcon), but this came directly from Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) - the NGO that owns the site. it was a top-down ban
