  * tracking experiments with events i could host
    * [[2024-01-15]]
      * i started space without scheduling it. Will nest the idea below. No one showed, so no value there it seems. But maybe if scheduled it would work?? not sure
        * EVENT: are there niche things on your mind you've been thinking about a lot, but have had no opportunities to talk about them? no one shows up then i talk about stuff on my mind - oh there's so much lol
          * memetic title: "anything you're itching to share, but have had no chance?"
    * [[2024-03-16]]
      * during vc meeting where the focus is not the experiment for everyone, but at the beginning a link is sent in chat and everyone is took to collab page where 1) you can see all emotes sent 2) there is emote to signal you had something to say and maybe leave self note so dont forget - it's like a button you just easily click to send signal quick
      * so the bookmark usecase in Emote notes

  * tracking thoughts from meetings
    * [[2024-01-18]]
      * my thoughts during this meeting
        * whats the tangible stuff? for example, i wanna get a fren involved, but there's nothing tangible for him to get involved. He works with coldcalling for startups so he knows connection, but in terms of selling stuff. Money.
    * [[2024-01-27]]
      * meeting with Victor and exobyt
        * resonated with basically talks about holigarchy (think that's what PL called it??). 
        * in end i mentioned having public obsidian graph of projects people can search. exobyt mentioned how this is centralized and doesnt allow project creators to edit - only Victor manually edits. Totally agreee that is issue, but i saw this more as in between tool to help people BEFORE Victor finishes the big tool he is building
    * [[2024-02-03]]
      * meeting with Victor, exobyt, and Gavin on discord and general stuff
        * something id like to do: go and ask each person publicly live how they envision vibecafe at its best ^YvoePbIzI
          * longterm, what do you want to do on a daily basis in relation to vibecafe?
          * Gavin: could be asynchronous
        * what is NOE from calendar? narratives of errthing
        * possilbe fail states
          * one successful project and you focus on it - then they leave vibecafe forever
        * TODO
          * [x] write out my desires for vibecafe related to [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking vibecafe#^YvoePbIzI|something id like to do: go and ask each person publicly live how they envision vibecafe at its best]]
          * [ ] see if victor wants to join vibecelium

  * possible improvements i can give:
    * stream live on X instead of twitch (or will that mess up X space?)
    * for twitch stream - turn music down during meetings somehow
  * issues
    * there was multiple people talking, but couldnt tell who they were. It just said terrace@vibecafexyz was talking on X space (also side note: notice how no one is watching on twitch, but many people on X space)
  * questions
    * how i personally think vibecafe could market itself to be most successful?
      * a place to come and brainstorm what you are building - especially when stuck
    * how do you envision vibecafe at its best? what about most successful? are these the same? can they be?
      * **at its best**
        * people can open resource that gives details of projects/people/teams and figure out who to connect with for very niche topics. If this resource doesnt work, they can get in contact with Victor. If he is too busy, they can socialize in the vibecafe until they get appropriately connected. I guess the point of this is: people are working on SOMETHING, they get blocked, the only way to get unblocked is to find the right person/people - and vibecafe provides that
        * people can just go there and be social or chill or vibe. good way to meet new people just for the sake of it. frens. people dont need a reason to be there - just to vibe
      * **at most successful**: satisfies "at its best" AND makes money somehow if money is still needed in this future. But money may be a requirement for success and that's the hard part, idk how to incorporate it without adding crappy things to the system
    * longterm, what do you want to do on a daily basis in relation to vibecafe?
      * to sit quietly with other people while i work on projects
      * to meet new random people
      * to meet new people that are connected to me OR my projects in very niche ways
      * a place to go and be heard
      * occasionally a place where i can go and listen to other people that wanna talk
      * to track all the projects people are working on and help them in any way possible (if i want to)
      * to get any of the things above and also provide the same for others when i can
