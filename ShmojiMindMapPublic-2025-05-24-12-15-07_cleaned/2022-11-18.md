    * Jaw floor/throat pain got to like 9/10 around 4pm. Then, i think i felt mucus slide down throat and i think pain decreased slightly. That sounds like an infection. And my lymph nodes are all swollen to hell. 
    * Lil red bumps on tonsils according to my step mom

    * I gargled with salt and vinegar and the very first gargle burnt. The following did not. I think pain decreased a bit after gargling, but still 6-7/10 pain

    * Something in throat seemingly popped and then liquidy slimy stuff went down throat. It tasted sweet oddly enough. Very sweet and i ate nothing sweet. My normal mucus has no taste
