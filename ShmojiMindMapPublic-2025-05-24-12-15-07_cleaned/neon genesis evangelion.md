    * is Shinji artificially created? is Rei?
    * why can only Shinji and Rei control the EVAs?
    * what is that program that Shinji's dad thinks is humanity's last hope?
    * why Shinji's dad such a dick?
    * what the heck is the first human Adam and why is it crucial to the Human project thing?
      * then in a later episode they say adam is first angel, not human, whatttt 
    * Are these angel attacks planned by NERV themselves?
    * bruh at end of episode 20, what the heck does that bro put in Misato's vajay?

    * what happened to Shinji's mom? Was she combined with alien found to create angels and EVAs and Reis?
    * Where did Dead Sea Scrolls comes from? Who created them?
    * Was the goal of both Seele and Gehirn to prevent the 3rd and final "thing" - contact - or whatever they call it
