    * Woke up in night to extremely blocked nose and extreme sinus/top-nose pain. Extremely blocked is rare. Also, had 8/10 intense left-bottom foot spasms. this is rare too. I think it's maybe due to eating Lays Potato chips because that was the only different thing i did yesterday. Other unlikely options that i did to cause those symptoms: Ceylon tea or Rose tea. Black Seed oil i took 2 days ago. Doubt it was those tho.
