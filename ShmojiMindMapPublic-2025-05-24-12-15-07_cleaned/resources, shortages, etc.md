    * tracking anecdotes
      * [[2024-04-08]]
        * Musk spoke about it again, all these notes from him
        * state of ai
          * voltage transformer supply is scarce resource. need transformers to run transformers
          * electricity availability is scarce resource
          * data problem - not enough data from humans. Too much for humans, but not many tokens for LLMs.
            * can use synthetic data OR real-world video (Tesla advantage)


  * shortages
    * SILICON: Elon: right now in 2023 we have silicon shortage
    * VOLTAGE STEP-DOWN TRANSFORMER SHORTAGE: Elon: silicon shortage turns into this shortage in 1 year from November 2023
      * so does silicon shortage go away once this one happens? Yes i think so. Elon said we'll have more than we can plugin in about 1 year
      * Elon: The limiting factor is voltage stepdown transformer
        * you have power coming in at 300k volts. It has to step down eventually to 0.7 volts - this is huge
      * need transformers to run transformer (this was funny to Elon and Lex)
    * ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE: Elon in 2 years from November 2023
