        * today was 3rd flight of starship
        * as of now, it is biggest flying object ever in space
        * they actually have starlink terminals on starship that helps with capturing the camera views
  * structures of ship
    * the flaps
      * to control altitude and positioning in air (maybe only during re-entry?)
      * there are 4 flaps that operate independently
    * heat shield tiles
      * helps dissipate heat
      * 18000 of them
      * hexagons
      * ceramic
      * protects belly of starship
      * really helps during re-entry
      * definitely on flaps, but maybe other places too?
    * Pez door
      * where you can deploy satellites from - they plan to use it for starlink satellites
