  * what is it?
    * some YTer:
      * HTTP is stateless - after initial request is done, the server-client communication is lost. Think of like flipping a coin multiple times - first flip result is not related to next flip result
      * Clients specify actions - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
      * Data sent with headers - headers sent with request AND response
