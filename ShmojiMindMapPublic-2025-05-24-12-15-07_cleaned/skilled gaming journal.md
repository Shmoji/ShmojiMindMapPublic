      * i start playing good when: 1) actions based in moment instead of based off my thoughts (short timescales) and 2) gain winner affect from a good play (typically one that surprises me and is from point 1)

      * last time i found improvement with 2 concepts. I think it's actually three. When i use these 3 concepts, i game like a sweaty tryhard: 1) be as in the moment as possible (short timescales), 2) accept and welcome suffering (especially bad body sensations, but also mental too), 3) winner effect (this is crucial, but i need to get better at knowing how to get there. Seems it usually takes a good play from short timescale self - usually more surprising, whereas longtime scale self plans everything out and is less likely to give winner effect)

      * playing mouse and keyboard on fortnite. i think sitting close to table with mouse as close to edge of table was working good. instead of wresting emo part of arm on table
