  * what it be?
    * the combination of groups and [[topological spaces]], i.e. they are groups and topological spaces at the same time, such that the continuity condition for the group operations connects these two structures together and consequently they are not independent from each other.
    * This means that not only can we talk about elements being combined according to the group operation, but we can also talk about elements being "close" to each other in the sense of the topology.
  * questions
    * what da significance?
      * ME: it a bridge yo
      * lies in their ability to bridge abstract algebra and topology, two major branches of mathematics.
    * can calculus be performed on topological groups?
      * They are general, so if they happen to be a lie group, then yes. If not, then not totally. While we can use some concepts from calculus in the study of topological groups (like continuity and limits), the full apparatus of differential calculus (including differentiation and integration of functions) requires a differentiable (or smooth) structure. So if this one is not a differential manifold, then it is not lie group - and cant perform the calc explained above.
