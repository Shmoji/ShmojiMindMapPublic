    * tracking thoughts on WHY local first - what is point?
      * [[2024-04-15]]
        * what is the solution for having too much data to store on the device you are using? file over app is gr8, except when file BIGGGG
          * Gordon: Local first works for a large class of app. IMO there's also a class of software where you just need the scale of the cloud. The question for me at that point is how to carve out some user agency and the ability to exit with useful data.
          * Peter van Hardenberg: piracy has always been local first and those files are the biggest. i agree with @gordonbrander there are times it isn't right but i don't think it's about file size as much as about figuring out what bits you need where. local first != local only
          * me: so it seems to be more about data access/availability and data ownership
          * after this convo, it seems localfirst is mostly about having access to specific data needed, even if no internet access
            * you could maybe take further and say as much functionality as possible still work when offline too
          * PvH: i think of the advantages of local-first software as being primarily -- durability & reliability of the system for the users and operational simplicity for the developers
  * tech enabling devs to create local first tech
