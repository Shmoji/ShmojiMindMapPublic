  * what is it? #memo ^ZTJ-s_1De
    * 2 or more atoms bonded together
    * more general version of compound
    * BROAD RANGE: molecules can range from simple diatomic molecules like O₂ (oxygen gas) or H₂ (hydrogen gas) to complex structures like DNA or proteins (4 main types of MACROMOLECULES)
    * DIFF IN MOLECULE AND COMPOUND: compound always 2 or more UNIQUE elements chemically bonded. molecules can be made of just one element like oxygen gas is (so oxygen gas is not compound, but iz pure molecule and pure element). BUT can have PURE COMPOUNDS: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/chemical element, compounds, mixtures#^UGser-cWT|PURE COMPOUND: substance made of molecules of one specific type of compound (pure water, pure sodium chloride)]]
    * ADDING SUBSTANCES DEFINITION GETS CONFUSING: at least here, no need to define these using the term substance - just focus on elements. Compound is a type of chemical unit of substances (element, compound, ion) - so iz nested under substance. Molecule could be nested under substance, but iznt useful, so just not there at all - already got other chemical units to cover all cases
    * COOL: a single cell contains billions-trillions of ORGANIC MOLECULES
    * TODO: one day learn difference in covalent and ionic bonds
