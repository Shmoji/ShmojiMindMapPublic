  * tracking low back pain
    * [[2023-10-02]]
      * went on run and right after noticed my low back felt tense and pain. Same tension and pain felt when sitting too long. So maybe bc i sat in office all day? But weird i only noticed after the run if that's the case

      * came home for holidays. after day 1 or 2, kidney areas on both sides started hurting like 1-2/10. Only reasons i can think of 1) CIRS trigger from toxins that started all this 2) ive been eating moderate amount of sweets and unhealthy in general 3) been sitting with bad posture (but typically i won't feel that consistently days after)

      * not really having much pain anymore. Maybe occasionally here and there. Like i twisted body while sitting and got 4/10 sharp pain near left kidney.
      * but occasionally also feeling tight/heavy feeling on both kidneys about 2-3/10. ive had this before and mentioned it somewhere, but cant remember where. i think this was all triggered during trip home - still wonder what did it

      * noticed last night there was much grumbling of tummy. You could literally hear gut creaking and squealing. Sometimes it felt like gas and would hurt for second before noise and then release. Makes me think not kidney pain and is gut pain ^MzRZijKcW

      * yesterday was thinking this pain was about gone after it triggered while at dads for xmas, but then today it's back around 3-4/10. Wonder why. Some ideas: 1) ate a few mochi 2) ate lots of potatoes last 2 days and they're not sibo legal

      * when laying in bed at night and start getting stomach gurgles, ive noticed for sure that sometimes these gurgles are correlated with pains that happen in lower back, kidney area. No idea why
    * [[2024-10-25]]
      * uncertain if it is on both sides or not. Seems like sometimes yes sometimes no
      * woke up in night and right side seemed to be hurting near kidney. Had to go pee. Prev day i had Ceylon tea for first time in forever around midday and had soup for dinner. Also been eating more peanut butter (oxalates) than usual - so hard to pinpoint cause of pain
      * i also did really good pushup workout few days ago that got entire back. And yesterday did really good calf-raise workout that maybe got pelvis/lower back area..but idk
      * tracking pain when it happens and tracking these specific activities too will make so i know which one is cause

  * tracking low back pain that happens on both sides and im pretty sure is from gut issue resonating to lower back/kidney area

      * yesterday ate a lotttt of pork which is rare. Also had black eyed peas for 2nd day in a row which caused lots of farts.
      * woke up today from night of nightmares and v tired with some chronic fatigue/weakness. Throughout day also noticed the lower back pain on both sides - often intensified when moving body in certain ways like twisting
    * [[2024-10-05]]
      * had this significantly yesterday. only weird thing i did was eat okra. Im writing day after this and now im having spasms and gas-like feelings right in those spots, which makes me think this is somehow gut pain in my kidney area. The day prior to this i also had more okra - with salmon that had some sauce from Boathouse

      * some strange body odor-like smell plagued me last night. so bad i couldnt sleep and had to go to dads. Biggest issue is that every breath in burns nostrils. Then my stomach started hurting, i felt nauseous, brain fog, chest hurts kinda like congestion, and entire body started aching. I woke up next day with the lower back/kidney pain
      * when i woke up in morning, i strangely peed 3 different times in span of hour instead of the normal one time when first waking up
