    * [[2022-09-27]]
      * Had dream where me, Tyler, and James went on plane hotel vacation. The inside of plane was super fancy hotel. We each had our own room. The majority of the dream i spent in Tyler's room because it was storming and it literally felt like plane was crashing the entire time. I thought we were goners. There were some chill moments where we played video games and i adventured around the plane. I remember plane landed safely in the end. 
    * [[2022-11-11]]
      * Had dream that some grotesque dude was someone i saw as a friend, but knew they would snap and they did. Started trying to kill me unless i gave them what they wanted. Not sure if this is feeling I have about other people, a feeling have about myself to other people, or a feeling i have about the world towards me
    * [[2022-11-30]]
      * Dreamt girls were hitting on me like crazy. Think it was bc previous day 2 girls came up to me at concert. Marty said they prob just wanted to talk and i think that boosted my ego apparently lol 
    * [[2023-02-15]]
      * Had dream i spent multiple days with Fronz. For some reason he really valued trust. Like i traveled with him wayyy out of town to some house. He was going out to town and i was staying in, but he didn't say when or if I'd see him again, so i asked. He responded as if i wouldn't see him again. His brother said "im giving you every signal that it's all good". I realized Fronz really values trust.
    * [[2023-03-07]]
      * Dream 1: Had dream that papa was ready to die and was living his last day happily with us. I was pissed and sad he decided that was last day. Also there was some scary doomsday alien thing going on lol. I woke up very sad and scared and tense physically. 
      * dream 2: Had dream that orcs, lion-men, and other races lived on Earth, but the west governments and rich people always hid it from the citizens. They only showed those races in fictional movies where they were treated poorly. I traveled and found out on my own
    * [[2023-03-08]]
      * was staying at dad's and past few days helicopters kept flying over and seemed to hover right over us. Then guy on weird ground machine showed up on front porch and his teammate was randomly in our kitchen. All they said was gonna do some work. Out of nowhere they were destroying entire trees in yard. First one pissed me off and that increased. Took 2nd one to piss dad off. Then we realized they clearly weren't listening to us. Out of nowhere Paige appeared and distracted me with convo. In middle of convo our house started getting exploded in weird video-game-deletion style. Was like roof and walls were being deleted. I ran to room to save some of my stuff. There was randomly a shit ton of people in our house, i guess stealing stuff. I started screaming WHY over and over. Mostly, no voice would come out. I woke up to that, felt tense and WHY was in my head. 
    * [[2023-04-07]]
      * Dreamt me and Tyler were flying fighter jets over Rocky Point. I ran out of gas over main Rocky Point and there was crapton of ppl hanging at gas station. Britney Davis was there lmao. 
      * I keep having this reoccurring dream that happens when im in between sleep and waking up where it feels like im using a computer to navigate the internet, but it's all in my mind. Guess i have neuralink on the mind or something 
    * [[2023-06-25]]
      * Was out somewhere and needed ride home i think. not sure why. Friend picked me up and already had friends with. Slowly realized we were going to beach instead of home. Felt intense sense of doing something i didn't wanna do. Just wanted to be home. Was at bar and music sucked, people sucked. Randomly people started fighting. One pulled out a knife. Shortly dream ended
    * [[2023-07-16]]
      * Had dream we all went on road trip in gigantic 18 wheeler to the mountains. Near end, we were trying to find the place and Jeremiah was driving through people's yards with the 18 wheeler lmao
    * [[2023-08-10]]
      * Felt like i went into dream playing with consciousness and it stuck a little - almost like lucid dreaming. I would let go in dream to change things
      * Only remember clips, but was at Nana's and she took me away from group into old room to tell me that there were flowers everywhere. From where she drove from all the way home was nothing but flowers everywhere. She was signalling how beautiful a thing it was and i felt it
      * Dream ended with me noticing belly button thing much larger than usual, freaks me out, and then i go to pick at it in bathroom and randomly peeing blood
    * [[2023-08-14]]

      * Had dream was with Marty and Teri and somehow fight started with Teri and group of people. I ran and hid bc thought they'd attack me too. Eventually i found them again. Noone hurt. Apparently Teri was mad bc we were in ocean and there was greater than 20 foot snakes all around... huhhh?
      * At one part in dream we drove on bridge that goes over ocean and bridge exact width of car with no rails. Then at end it was blocked off like not even a path. Marty still drove and we made it anyways.
      * Me and Tyler were swimming at some place. Randomly i noticed dead fish. I finally found Tyler and he was swimming back with croc following. I told him and he really swam fast then to me where he just makes it inside building on dock. I start trash talking the croc lmao. "what you gonna do bitch"
    * [[2023-08-22]]
      * had dream where throughout a day i was texting 2 diff girls on and off. I think one was B. She seemed to have something like CIRS too. I went hiking alone and it got terrifying near end. Thinking about her texts brought me out of that fear. After hike went and hung out with her. Mostly bland, but hiking part felt quite scary. 
      * Cant remember who other girl was 
    * [[2023-08-24]]
      * Had multiple complex dreams. All i remember is i was in apartment and it looked totally different. Like a dorm. It had basement you can see from floor above. It was dark and gigantic with soft red velvet couches all over. Also there were moving mechanical creations.
    * [[2023-08-26]]
      * Dreams in setting of my old elementary or middle school. I remember going in same bathroom as Matt Tyndal and saying mannn i need a gf. He just laughed like he related. Then i walked back towards class and noticed everyone was leaving despite how early it was. Nothing significant about this ending but ended here. i woke up feeling physically bad for some reason despite no bad events.
      * Also remember walking through gym while my school's team just finished losing some sports match. I didnt really care and felt pride i didnt care
      * I barely have been able to remember them, but last 2 nights i have dreamt the entire nights, it's crazy - why randomly so much? 
    * [[2023-08-31]]
      * some girl idk in my dream with black hair that I mutually vibed with
      * someone was explaining something that can cause deviated septum in my dream. Interesting that is dream just before getting braces
    * [[2023-09-01]]
      * was hanging at mall with some friends. Most were lgbt. We departed
      * I was chilling on a public bench and so were other people on bench close. Randomly some girl came and cuddled with me on the bench. What the hell. She started talking about life and dream happily ended. 
      * In last dream i dont remember much, but i know Kobe was in it and i asked if he still went by that name for some reason 
    * [[2023-09-02]]
      * Had many dreams last night. Only thing i remember is i was here in NC and there was somehow aurora.
    * [[2023-09-04]]
      * dream at Nana's. There was some sort of storm incoming. We all doing our own thing but somehow we all learn storm coming. Whole close fam there. It hits and everything starts shaking like earthquake. I jump into bathtub in our bathroom. There just happens to be 3 kittens in there. They adorably climb all over me. Storm subsides and i take kittens out. Dad has door open and i struggle to keep them inside, but with help of dad's foot we succeed. no significant eventful ending. 
      * dream 2: some weird dream where i think i was lucid dreaming. It was terrifying because i couldn't tell dream from not dream. i was just laying in my bed. But in different positions i knew I wasn't in in real life..or was? Cascade of fear until i actually woke up. I think lucid dream triggered when i had concept of deep time in dream. Then i interacted with it non-conceptually from outside time. I imaged living entities of future with gigantic bodies that we evolve into. 
    * [[2023-09-07]]
      * Was at war with some people. For some reason society was not advanced. Best weapons were spears. Me and others convinced everyone to stop a battle early so some on enemy side could survive. Then, it ended and we celebrated. A guy from losing side was having fun wooden stick fight with our guy. Losing at first, but then pulls some amazing stunts to win. He brags a bit right after winning and our main leader just happens to be walking by. He orders all old enemies be killed after hearing it. That guy is killed and guy with him is running and me and my bro hide him between our back (a dog that looked like Ember) and a wall. 
    * [[2023-09-13]]
      * had dream was riding in car with papa and nana and maybe other people. Papa was driving and basically hitting ramps and getting huge air. He somehow drove over water. And somehow i knew if he did it wrong, we would sink. I was terrified the whole time, but we ended up safe. Sounds like my relationship with his anger.
      * Had another dream where my good friend James was now working for a nanobot company. He had to take me somewhere super private to tell me.
    * [[2023-09-30]]
      * Was with fam at some mountain location - maybe vacation? everyone was there, even fam that is no longer fam.
      * Me and Tyler left for a bit. There was flying device at top of mountain you can get in that was connected by big ladder to ground but still was up high
      * Once we got in it we started realizing we fucked up. It as apparently orbiting around the earth at a very high speed
      * We were right above the clouds and they looked beautiful - but they were in distance. Tyler pointed out there was ice at the top of the clouds. when the clouds reached the device we were in, the ice started slamming into the windshield of the device. Scared it was gonna break.
      * Finally cloudy ice went away and we got out
      * But quickly a new threat emerged
      * We were walking down mountain road back to house when Tyler said something expressing our danger. There was some sort of creature that was invisible, but had a doctor who like cape and in shape of dog. It was able to basically use the force on Tyler from far, but couldn't use that technique on me
      * I think we work together to defeat it, but then another enemy appears
      * this thing looks like a flying dragon radar except completely metal on all sides
      * the enemy was only visible on one side. It was virtual and lived in screen of that one side. But we learned the attack it does can hit any side of device
      * I tried grabbing side the screen wasn't on and smashing the thing against wall but then it would cut your hand as soon as it touched the device
      * Then we realized we had to smash it with something heavy. I think that's what we did and i don't remember much else
    * [[2023-10-05]]
      * had dream of solar eclipse. it was huge in sky and  watched with Tyler from Nana's yard. 
      * Later in dream went to concert where lots of childhood schoolmates were randomly there.
      * Someone kept jokingly calling someone else a terrorist
      * We apparently took someone's seats so Ryan moved and sat on stairs. Kinda in way so i went and stood elsewhere. Some random dude that almost looked like security tazed me. No idea why but I went all the way to the back and watched from the field. It was Pierce the Veil. 
    * [[2023-10-28]]
      * all dreams last night were about escaping death but I have no idea why. 
      * in one dream, some gay dude is chasing me with knife
      * in another dream, giant meteors falling from sky and hurting people. Planes crashing. Felt like being attacked but never saw anyone attacking. Was triple rainbow and triple meteors
      * things i did differently yesterday and possible reasons for scary dreams for first time in forever: 1) ate [[cod liver]] 2) teeth been hurting from new wire just put in
    * [[2023-11-04]]
      * Only remember end of dream. In some house i didn't recognize, but seemed like Papa's mom/Dad's place in Greensboro.
      * For some reason i was alone in room while everyone else socializing. It was mom, nana, and 2 Tylers lol. I saw when i finally went out there. One Tyler was leaving and other chilling on porch. I questioned if i should leave too. 
      * no big events that i can remember 
    * [[2023-11-05]]
      * Was at some sort of peer or beach. Me and Tyler were being taught to do something at edge of water
      * Randomly something started pulling the water up and out. There was a huge killer whale or whatever you call the 2 colored one. I grabbed onto a jet ski that Tyler was also on. Someone else was driving. We safely made it back and that was about it
    * [[2023-11-16]]
      * Had dream where i was in maybe middle school
      * Walked outside to some building when saw UFO that was tan colored with spots crashing to ground very close
      * Nothing else too significant other than flirting with some Chinese chick, but she apparently flirts with everyone
    * [[2023-11-18]]
      * Was riding with T on handle bars of bike in hood. Saw some weird 1880s looking plane flying overhead - 2 of them. 
    * [[2023-11-20]]
      * another dream where i fell asleep in first dream
      * I woke up on floor of Nana's bathroom to Jake and Ryan showing up. Jake said there was fighting with fam at his place so he staying with me. Said it was serious and Kade actually cried which i thought sounded like may be good thing and progress 
      * Was struggling to sleep in dream lol. Finally slept and woke up again on floor outside Nana's room door.
      * Everyone was awake at like 2am doing stuff. Dad was doing projects for nana and papa
      * He said my stomach looked large and i knew he was talking of bloating. i mentioned my plan to do sibo diet once bad food of Holidays over
      * dad was v young and skinny looking

      * Wonder if i sleep in dreams when attempting to lucid dream
    * [[2023-11-21]]
      * had a dream about some sort of anteater/tiger mix. It was menacing. Me and all Wilmy squad chilling in garden room and it just showed up.
    * [[2023-11-24]]
      * had dream socializing at Dad's with some coworkers. We create software i guess
      * One was Indian chick
      * other was teaching a game where you wrap hand around other hand in gun posture so that tip of finger barrel barely sticks out. Also so your thumb barely sticks out which i think was key
      * the key was that as you create, the less you reveal of your thumb, the better the creation. So more limitations the better for some reason
      * tbh not totally sure game makes sense lol
    * [[2023-12-03]]
      * had dream i was in some house i never seen with Ryan, Jake, some girl, and Lisa. We kept trying to sleep but kept waking up. 
      * at end of dream i laid back on bed, environment and body started shaking until my vision started turning white. Ended with white space with like an ice cream truck. Something felt alien. Quickly after i woke up. 
    * [[2023-12-04]]
      * Haley and Blake were in dream. We were in Jake's old backyard for some event/game where it felt like a battle royal except you just move to location lol. Seemed like maybe a church group was participating.
    * [[2023-12-06]]
      * had multiple dreams.
      * 1) was in some sort of school that kinda looked like my elementary school. Was in a class that just ended and some blonde girl came and started doing dances with our hands together. I think i initiated it bc she was crying or something. Guess we were dating or something.
      * 2) seemed to be in one of mom's old houses, but dont think i ever saw mom. It was me, Jake, and someone there watching a scary gorey movie. I was really not enjoying the gore. Once done, i fell asleep in living room. Woke up to bunch of random college-like people all around. I was paranoid they did something to me, but they seemed nice. I think some ginger chick was nice to me and dream ended with me saying "warmth of the heart" or something like that
    * [[2023-12-10]]
      * had dream was just chilling with the Wilmy bois and we were v casually just time traveling
    * [[2023-12-14]]
      * Was at a university or something.
      * Was with a couple with emo aesthetic i think. They seemed to really be into me for some reason.
      * Felt like i related with them in authentic way similar to M2. They made video content and i was in it lol. 
      * Randomly saw my bro. I randomly had some lock in my hand and he had other side to unlock, but then the lock was like stabbed in my hand - i basically woke up here. 
      * unsure if same dream, but i was cold, so i got out of bed, turned heat on, and went back to bed. Then i woke up cold as shiz to find that was a dream and i didn't turn the heat on
    * [[2023-12-15]]
      * had dream was back in middle school and talking to literally everyone. I remember no significant events.
