    * Sometimes i have this thing that feels like an issue. I offer how i relate with people as way to connect and empathize emotionally. However, i feel this often comes off as me taking attention from them and onto me. That's not how i mean it. I mean it as way to connect or way to help someone stop hyperfocusing on their own issues. But maybe this is just distracting them and isnt great. I know distraction from issues is not correct solution. It's like socially im Fi in terms of helping one person and using personal experiences to help. But my focus is on them, so it sounds Fe. Seems like internally Fe, but displayed to public as Fi maybe?? [[finding-my-mbti-type]]
