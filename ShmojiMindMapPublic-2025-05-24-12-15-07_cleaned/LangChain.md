    * Chains ^fULbYpnBe
      * my understanding
        * based on LangFlow: chain allows you to combine multiple components of using LLM (prompts, LLMs, memory) into one button click.
      * sequence of calls to LLMs and utils; apparently the true value of LangChain according to tut on interwebz
      * docs definitions
        * end-to-end wrapper around multiple individual components (components are many things - memory, LLMs, prompts, etc)
        * Chains even allow you to use multiple LLMs with one execution of some button
  * Issues / costs
    * Using a tool like search costs money
      * serpAPI has free plan of 100 searches per month
      * 5000 searches per month costs $50 per month
