      * [[2025-01-09]] how to book flights #[[fast memo]]
        * BOOKING SERVICE 2 AIRLINE SWITCHAROO: apparently iz best to use booking service to find the cheapest flight and then actually book directly with the airline to ensure better customer service and easier modifications to your reservation
        * BEST CHEAP FLIGHT FINDER: with quick search, everyone says [[Google Flights]] is best for finding cheap flights and my exp seems to find that true
        * MULTIPLE AIRLINES IN ONE TRIP: often, there are multiple airlines for best price. You can then check both airline sites for best price and book through that airline (often youll find same flight from google flights there, esp if the airlines have codeshare agreement or alliance). EVEN BETTER: if those 2 airlines have codeshare agreement or alliance. You can just search up if they do if you want

  * notes
    * everywhere online says you need to check in either online or at check-in counter in person and then after, you get boarding pass. That was not true for me. I had boarding pass on phone all along and i just had it scanned before TSA (airport security)
      * im wondering if it will also be scanned before getting on plane. Answer: yes
  * things i need next time
    * a bag that rolls
  * airport process
    * RIDE TO TERMINAL: get literal car ride to your terminal
    * SOMETIMES, AFTER TSA, TRAVEL TIME TO GATE CAN BE LONG: sometimes after getting through TSA, you need to get on bus/train to get to your gate, so take that into mind too
    * first thing is go through TSA
      * you'll see some sign saying "all gates" or something
      * You wait in line until you give passport or license to person. Then you put each bag in a grey box that goes through machine
      * Some airports are more strict and you have to put your shoes in box too. Also they want electronics separate from your bags. This sucks when you packed them all tight in one bag.
      * They expect you to stay at entrance of machine until your last item goes through. Then you can walk through other machine (just walk towards person at machine or wave or whatevs)
      * They also expect you to push your items when on conveyor part that doesn't move on own. Tripped me up
      * Then at end it seems you grab your stuff insanely quick and put the grey bag-holding tubs stacked in thing (how the fuq were people doing this so quick). I think it's possible you can also take your stuff and grey tubs to a table if you are slow like me but idk
    * DEPARTURE GATE: find your flight departure gate and wait
    * fly
