  * [[Brainstorming]]
    * Found i enjoy making videos on my experiences, but i feel i want them to offer value to others aside from just seeing my daily life. Like how Life Where I'm From offers value. I might start each video with issues I'm having in life and seeing if i can make progress on those issues throughout my daily experiences
