  * Post-game content
    * You have to re-beat all the gyms again. The lore is that's the way to make sure the gyms are still good. Typically Geeta the champion does it, but sends you instead
    * After beating all gyms again, you defeat 4 trainers in the Ace Academy Tournament
    * You unlock 5 star raids from beating game. After beating tournament, Jacq calls and you have to go beat a bunch of 5 star raids... then eventually after 15 defeated he calls you and tells you that you unlocked 6 star raids - which are BLACK crystals.
    * Find 32 stakes to unlock legendary
    * After beating main story, go back to very bottom of Area Zero to find another legendary Koraidon or Miraidon (you can find it - i believe in you)

        * level 75
      * Tera Raid 6 (black crystals)
        * level 90

  * questions
    * what is best and quickest way to level Pokemon?
      * if you have a pokemon > 90
        * level 6-7 tera raids
      * if you have a pokemon > 75
        * level 5 tera raids
      * if you have a pokemon > 55
        * do same as note below, except go to Area 0 Research lab 3, turn right out of bulding, and go to small cave to farm chansey
      * If you have a pokemon > 40-45:
        * Other notes
          * auto-battle doesnt give bunch of exp, so dont do that
          * Put lucky egg on main fighter for more XP (you get this from Jacq sometime during main story)
        * follow this:
          * Go to Sure Cans, buy bunch of pickles
          * Go to Artisan Bakery, buy bunch of Mayo, Mustard, and Ham
          * Go to Area 3 of North Province. Picnic, create HAM sammy, you get buff to encounter more normal type pokemon
          * Go down hill and fight tons of Chanseys and Blisseys for tons of experience points. 
    * where to look at your current buffs?
      * right on D-pad
