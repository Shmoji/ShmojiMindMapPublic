    * May protect **brain **health. Neuroinflammation is inflammation of brain tissue. It’s thought to play an important role in the development of **diseases **like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Maybe **thymoquinone **in black seed oil may reduce neuroinflammation based on research. One study in 40 healthy older adults found significant improvements in measures of **memory**, **attention**, and **cognition **after taking 500 mg of **N. sativa** capsules twice a day for 9 weeks
    * May be good for **skin **and **hair **due to its antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. Less research done on hair benefits.

In one reported case, a woman with type 2 diabetes was hospitalized for acute kidney failure after taking 2–2.5 grams of black seed capsules daily for 6 days. However, other studies haven’t shown negative effects on kidney health. In fact, some studies have even suggested that black seed oil has a protective effect on kidney function
