  * non-VR games
    * **Nier Replicant**. Absolutely beautiful game. Felt like I was watching an anime. Not a game I'd replay, even though it has various amazing endings (i just looked them up to know story)
    * [[nier automata]]
    * [[Super Mario 64]]
    * Banjo Kazooie
    * **Psychonauts 1**. Great game. Platforming is fun and pretty difficult at times. Puzzles are probably the best part because sometimes you'll just have no idea how to continue..and then it ends up being more simple than you were making it. The story is pretty good and interesting. The metaphors for mental states are amazing.
    * **The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.** Played sometime in college, so only vaguely remember. Mainly remember tons of fun puzzles.
    * [[The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past]]
    * [[Animal Crossing]]
    * [[Klonoa Door to Phantomile]]
    * Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil
    * Shady Part of Me
    * [[Demon's Crest]]
    * [[Ghosts n Goblins game]]
      * i beat the Arcade version and NES version, but not resurrection
    * [[Marble It Up! series]] - 2 games
  * VR games
    * Psychonauts: Rhombus of Ruin
    * Shores of Loci
      * Like puzzle you play on table, except 3D in VR
      * Beautiful visuals
      * Amazing and relaxing music and sounds
      * No story really, you just put things together
      * 5 worlds
