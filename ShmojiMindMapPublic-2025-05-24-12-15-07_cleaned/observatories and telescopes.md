  * list of observatories
    * Vera C Rubin observatory
      * scan entire southern sky every few nights
      * what it will definitely do
        * reveal thousands of previously unknown comets and asteroids
      * predictions
        * Vera Rubin will discover dozens of interstellar objects - some may be perfect targets to be intercepted
        * There are probably only 50 1-km city killing space objects left to discover, but still around 14,000 in the 140-meter range. Vera Rubin should help find these according to Fraser Cain
        * Vera Rubin will find binary supermassive blackholes
    * neutrino observatories

      * Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)
        * details
          * same size as JWST, but carry a suite of instruments that'll let it directly observe the atmospheres of Earth-sized worlds orbiting Sunlike stars in the habitable zone.
