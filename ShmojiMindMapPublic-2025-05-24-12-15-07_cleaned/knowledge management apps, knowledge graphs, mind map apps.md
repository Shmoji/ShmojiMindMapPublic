      * [[Wikibase]] and WikiData
        * Data is stored in central database of some sorts. Issue here is that it's probably not stored in decentralized network or onchain
        * It seems this data is only meant for collaborative usecases and not where user data for a site should be stored. GPT says: Wikibase, including Wikidata, is designed primarily for storing structured data related to real-world entities, facts, and knowledge. It's not intended for storing user-specific data like personal information, preferences, or app-related data.
