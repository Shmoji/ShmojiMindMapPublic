      * all day had 3-4/10 drainage. i feel it at all times running down throat near back of tongue except in throat.
      * no idea why, but last 3-4 days have had sinus pain for first time in month
      * possible reasons for drainage: 1) ate goat cheese today 2) whatever caused sinus pain days ago (maybe icecream but idk)

      * after drinking roasted dandelion root tea in morning, had like 2-3 drainage in typical spot of running down throat near back of tongue except in throat.
      * stayed about same all day - it's currently just after lunch now tho

      * ate chocolate melts from whole foods for first time in about a week and it triggered 2-3/10 mucus down throat around lunch. Then i ate more and dinner and went to 4/10. Drainage has not stopped all day

      * i wasnt really tracking previous days, but i assume it wasnt too bad since i didnt record here. But today it's about 3-4/10 all day since lunch. I ate 2 protein bars that had chocolate. My guess is that triggered it

      * intensity about 5-6/10 for hour or so. only idea is bc of okra. had shrimp and okra for lunch. i actually had okra yesterday too but cant remember if pain followed - but definitely had back of throat drainage (it was with salmon and peaches)

      * this happened and bloating of 3-4/10 happened immediately after. i ate Moes bowl custom made: cilantro rice, pico, cilantro, black beans, white chicken, lettuce. i dont usually do cilantro rice or pico, but uncertain if they are cause or not - could even be the seasoning which isnt listed
      * also had hummus with moes chips - could be cause too
