  * how to understand this and "fix" it
    * Dr K
      * youre doing this for yourself. you're talking with yourself
      * wanting to talk with someone is for your desire and fulfilment. not wanting to bother someone is STILL for your desire and fulfillment
      * if you dont talk to person, you feel "thank god i didnt annoy this person"
      * you're listening to yourself and relying on what you want
      * you solve this by including another human. Ask if ur being annoying - can use open ended version - dont trauma dump
