  * what is it?
    * me: idek. it's more local and it's a network lol
    * wikipedia: A mesh network is a local area network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data to and from clients
  * questions
    * are they illegal?
      * No. But not really welcomed by ISPs which provide the network connectivity most mesh networks operate from
    * how does mesh network connectivity happen without ISP?
      * LEARNT: got learnt that mesh network connectivity is different than connecting to global internet
      * Me: communication between nodes which uses different forms of electromagnetic radiation depending on usecase of network
      * GPT4:
        * typically happens using radio waves, which are a form of electromagnetic radiation, including certain spectrums of light. The specific technologies and frequencies used can vary depending on the type of mesh network and its intended use. Here are the primary methods through which nodes in a mesh network communicate:
        * ### 1. **WiFi**
          * Most home and business mesh networks use WiFi technology for communication between nodes. WiFi operates in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands, which are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These frequencies allow for wireless data transmission over short distances and are well-suited for indoor environments where mesh networks are commonly deployed.
        * ### 2. **Bluetooth**
          * Some mesh networks, especially those designed for IoT (Internet of Things) applications, might use Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth also uses radio waves, typically in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, to communicate over short distances. Bluetooth mesh networking is optimized for low power consumption and is ideal for connecting a large number of small, battery-operated devices.
        * ### 3. **Zigbee and Z-Wave**
          * Zigbee and Z-Wave are wireless communication protocols designed for low-power IoT networks, including home automation systems. Zigbee operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band (globally), as well as 868 MHz in Europe and 915 MHz in the USA and Australia. Z-Wave typically operates at sub-1 GHz frequencies, such as 908.42 MHz in the USA and various other frequencies depending on the country. These technologies are used for creating mesh networks among devices like smart thermostats, lights, and security sensors.
        * ### 4. **Visible Light Communication (VLC)**
          * While less common, some experimental mesh networks use visible light communication (VLC) for data transmission. VLC involves modulating light at frequencies imperceptible to the human eye to transmit data. This can be done using LED lights. VLC is a line-of-sight technology and can be used in applications where traditional radio frequency communication might be problematic.
        * ### 5. **Longer Range Radio Frequencies**
          * For wider area mesh networks, such as those used in rural broadband access or sensor networks covering large geographical areas, longer-range radio frequencies might be used. These can include licensed and unlicensed bands, with technologies designed to provide low-bandwidth connectivity over long distances, such as LoRaWAN, which operates in various sub-gigahertz frequency bands.
    * how does mesh network connect to global internet? how does it do it without ISP?

    * is your wifi a mesh network?
      * No, i dont think so. You connect to your ISPs network - which isnt really local and is more complex, so not mesh network
  * related
