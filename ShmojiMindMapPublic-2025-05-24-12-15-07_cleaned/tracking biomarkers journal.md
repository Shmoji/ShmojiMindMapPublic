  * NOTE: will use this as journal to make myself membuh stuff about my body lol
  * tracking
    * [[2024-11-20]] my calcium levels, my Vitamin D levels, my PTH levels #[[fast memo]]
      * since like 2017 my BLOOD calcium levels have been either just BEFORE/ON border of being HIGH or being very very slightly HIGH. tldr: for years, my calcium levels has been suspiciously high which aligns with my calcium oxalate kidney stones that very very easily form chronically for past decade
      * since 2022 (maybe earlier?) my Vitamin D levels are LOW every time tested. it is essential to bone and mineral health.
      * my phosphorus at end of 2024 was JUST in range, but almost LOW. Which this aligns with Vitamin D levels being low bc: Vitamin D deficiency impairs bone health and the body's ability to absorb phosphorus. gets pooed instead, not on bloodstream
      * well i was predicting my PTH levels to be very high. They ended up being almost too low, but just in range at the border. So...my calcium levels are not high due to parathyroid then??
      * something is running up my calcium levels for years and body is reacting appropriately by suppressing PTH production (bc high PTH would just increase calcium more). So parathyroid glands are working fine, but SOMETHING is running up calcium levels which is no good as seen with stones lol
      * hmm i feel like i should increase my vitamin D, but everything i read says that increases calcium levels...which i dont need more calcium for more stones. Or maybe it would end up fixing my calcium metabolism instead...idk
