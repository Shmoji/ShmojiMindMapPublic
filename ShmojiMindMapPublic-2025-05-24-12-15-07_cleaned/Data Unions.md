  * Questions
    * Is running a data union basically a part time job?
      * Right now it basically is. All clients of DataUnion are full-time companies
    * How much does it cost to run data union? I know you have to run the provider yourself. Maybe AWS fees?
      * Basically running the server. And depending how much consume compute the datasets need determines cost.
    * Will there ever be a more web3 way? Maybe the data union has a DAO and the DAO uses its funds to pay for running the provider?
      * A DAO could probably do it, but you gotta get serious people together to do it.
      * Using NFTs and DAOs and Node network (this is direction Robin CEO wants to go)
        * NFT where all settings of DataUnion are managed on chain, which includes all connections between data and its enhancements, manages consent and access via creating, minting, sending datatokens for the members DataNFTs.
        * Also, manages value shares for data recycling and data creation from bounties
        * DAO: A DAO attached to manage the parameters of NFT and do governance
        * Node network: node software that organizes that provider stays running, data is cached on node, and data is used for compute-to-data
    * If you had to give steps to setup a data union, what would you say goes into that?
      * Didnt get a great answer.
    * I cant find any docs on the tech behind DataUnions. The tech is how i usually judge the value behind a project. Like if i wanted to start a dataUnion, is that completely on my own or does the DataUnion app help in some way? does it offer a tech stack or is it more helping through advice or advisors?
      * Seems there is tech, but it's not super far yet.
  * Notes
    * Random notes from call with Robin CEO of DataUnion
      * You can wrap smart contract around data NFT and makes it so somehow can control where funds go for all data union members
      * He says users of mobile app interact with blockchain once and then never have to again
    * My data union ideas
      * General health data union
      * Video game clips data union
      * ANY video data union (is this what Mantis is??)
      * Mind model data union
