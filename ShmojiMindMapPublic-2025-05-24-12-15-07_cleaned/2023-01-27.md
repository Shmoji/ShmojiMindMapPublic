  * random
    * Find list of movies for dad to watch based around anything being possible (especially if focused on older people)
    * A huge part of who i am was given to me by you. That sounds obvious because im your son, but that's not the point. Throughout my childhood you continuously told me that I can do anything i put my mind to. That anything is possible. And that became a core part of who i am. With that quality, i have been able to achieve many things and i will continue achieving more and more. Because i know that anything is possible.
    * Now I want to transfer that quality back to you. I want to make sure that you know that you can do anything you put your mind to. Whether that is quitting some addiction, becoming rich from investments, traveling across the country again, or anything else. You can do absolutely anything. I believe it. 
    * It won't be easy, but you can absolutely do anything. Emotions may make it feel like some things are impossible. But that's just a feeling. And i'll always be here to remind you the same thing that you reminded me throughout my life. That life is tough as shit, but it's also amazing and you can accomplish anything you set your mind to.
    * If you ever feel down and find it hard to believe in your ability to accomplish your goals, obviously I'm always here, but also here is a list of movies you can watch that should help inspire again. I haven't seen most of these, so they may end up being unrelated, but either way, gives you some movies to watch hahah.
