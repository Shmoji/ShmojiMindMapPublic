      * found out today that they are no longer using OCEAN according to their X account - sadge - they said they instead work directly with data brokers. Is this a bad thing? couldnt they sell to data brokers without you knowing and then the data brokers just sell your data too? i guess main difference is that Decentr gives you some payments back
      * think ill see how much i get paid by decentr when this new version comes out and if not cool, ill try switching main browser to Arc

  * TODO
    * [ ] If you end up getting lot of DEC tokens, do what is recommended below for this topic
  * Questions / things i dont get
    * Because user data is securely valued, a proportionate value of this data is returned to users in Decentr’s native token $DEC, directly into a user's dWallet each month. The dWallet is integrated as part of a user’s account.
      * So you cant choose how you sell your data and who it is to? It somehow randomly gets converted to their native token??
  * How Tos
    * how to see all your data put on blockchain
      * In dPortal, go to activity tab
  * Notes
    * What happens to your data
      * It is anonymized and then put on blockchain
    * Terms / tech
      * PDV (Personal Data Value)
        * PDV functions as a ‘personalized’ exchange rate that allows users to gain economic benefits based on the value of their data, as determined by their PDV rate.
        * As with any ‘exchange rate’, the rate increase is determined by demand for the underlying ‘currency’ – in the case of PDV, the underlying ‘currency’ is the data that users generate as they browse the web and metaweb. This creates a true, user-centric data currency and economy.
    * How rewards work right now
      * It seems integration with OCEAN isnt complete yet, so instead they do this: While the gap data sale gap is being bridged, Decentr has designed an alternative method to incentivise users:
As users interact with the Decentr ecosystem their PDV grows in value. Decentr currently provides a pool of 300 000 DEC rewards each month. Decentr will take the total PDV difference over the course of a month for a user and distribute a reward in DEC from the rewards pool, proportional to their share of overall PDV.
    * Random
      * There is Decentr app
    * What makes this browser valuable?
      * It stores and values all your browser data as part of your DecID. I believe it uses OCEAN
    * How Decentr is different than other browsers
      * Existing browsers, like Chrome and Firefox, interact with web3 via extensions and are obviously not natively blockchain aware. Even the current crypto browser of choice, Brave, is not an actual web3 browser and uses ERC20 to connect to a centralized wallet provider in Uphold (this is past their somewhat shaky token utility and incentivisation model). The Decentr browser now changes all of this and, as a result, our short term adoption and user acquisition strategy is based on the crypto ecosystem itself.
    * What to do on certain events
      * If you end up getting DEC tokens
        * Delegate your stake for rewards. "The APR on network rewards is currently ~20%. By creating a Decentr node or [delegating your stake](https://decentrnet.medium.com/delegated-staking-via-the-decentr-browser-is-now-live-d0973fd94c47) of native DEC tokens towards a node, you will not only be earning these network rewards, but also helping support and decentralize the Decentr blockchain and ecosystem. Even better, DEC token holders who wish to delegate their stake to a Decentr node can now do so directly via the Decentr browser."
