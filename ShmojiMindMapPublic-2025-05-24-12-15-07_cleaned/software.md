  * key points
    * software is completely mechanical/mathematical/causal - BUT it is also disembodied - like US
    * can software perceive despite being purely mechanical? me: i think so.
    * computer is causal insulator. Works same way (mostly) regardless of universe around it. Such an insulator can be used to make arbitrary models of past, present, and future. These models need to be decoupled from what's happening right now (why?).
