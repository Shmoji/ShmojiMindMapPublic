    * This morning i put about 1/4 a scoop of Mag Glycinate in tea. About hour after consuming, the entire day i was having upset stomach, kidney stone pain, and liquid poop. Think i took too much magnesium. I also had lemon which also softens poop i think. I have no idea why that triggers kidney stone pain tho. Maybe lemon or Mag break down the stone in there and then it moves? Maybe the extra poop moisture feeds some tummy bacteria and then the bacteria starts producing oxalates which causes stone pain?
    * Kidney stone pain took the entire day. Only thing that gave enough comfort to sleep was weed with heating pad. I tried everything else possible. Hot bath also helped, but temporary. Good to force self to eat/drink...but just puke back up later.
