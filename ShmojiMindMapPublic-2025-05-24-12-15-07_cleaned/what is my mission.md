  * tracking what is my purpose or mission
    * [[2024-09-08]]
      * what i do (seems to be what i always return to)
      * so every moment, no matter what im doing. what im doing is my purpose

  * my mission (as a static updated entity)
    * Maximize agency with fun and love and acceptance of every state of existence
    * Minimize wrath
      * This looks like forgiving the most wicked people and giving them a voice on their journey, no matter what they say (censorship is not the answer)
    * make it easier for people to be seen for the niche things inside that typically go unseen
    * connect people and make connection easier
  * brainstorming randomness
    * brainstorming my mission
      * well i feel called to create. for both myself and others. 
      * i feel called to provide fun, lightheartedness, seriousness, everything really - in a way that allows people to express themselves completely. 
      * Trying to figure out my mission this weekend. People around the world want to experiment with all kinds of different stuff. However, often, the chance never appears. I think my mission may be related to amplifying the desired experiments of people so they can experiment. Typically the hard part here is connecting people
