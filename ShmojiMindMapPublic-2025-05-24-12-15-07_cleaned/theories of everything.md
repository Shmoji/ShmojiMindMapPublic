  * list of big ones
    * 1: Karl Friston's free energy principle (FEP)
      * Every intelligence, organism, and generalized agent is minimzing free energy in its environment by producing adaptive complexity that makes the most of what the environment has to offer
    * 2: Stephen Wolfram's Ruliad
      * Ruliad = limit of computational possibilities
    * 3: Teilhard de Chardin
      * Proposed that God does not fully exist yet in this moment and is bootstrapping himself until he reached the ultimate omega point perfection at end of universe.
    * 4: Frank Tipler created own version of 3: cells will produce intelligent species which will produce elons who send self-replicating von Neumann probes to space which will colonize the entire visible universe with intelligent civilizations - which will use chaos theoretic butterfly effects to rebuild everything into a single omega point computer that will ressurect every intelligent being that ever lived in its eternal afterlife simulator.
