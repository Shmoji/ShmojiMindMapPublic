  * creating abstract art
    * i always get blocked when just trying to run with some vague idea/motivation
  * creating content in general
    * basically same as abstract art - i often get blocked for some reason and i never create the creations in my head (except for the very concrete stuff, but i desire to get out more "art-like" stuff)
  * consistently getting embodied from a very disembodied state
  * how to authentically do intros and outros in convo. They never feel natural and if i have to do it it feels forced
  * someone that can trigger the trauma i get just before standup and help me to get it to lose control over me
  * drugs
    * weed mentor - specifically how to maximize 1) enjoyment and 2) usefulness 3) to learn as much about reality as possible
    * psychedelics mentors - specifically how to maximize 1) enjoyment and 2) usefulness 3) to learn as much about reality as possible
  * Health: don't really need mentor, more like i need rich scientist to take me in and solve my chronic mysterious issues
