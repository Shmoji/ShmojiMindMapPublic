    * doing something i am passionate about
    * i need to be part of a community that i like and interact with in my day to day life
    * there needs to be adventure in my day to day life - could be research, travel, etc
    * the specific job i am doing is spent doing mostly things I want to do. For example, rn at current job i spend most time coding and i dont wanna spend all day everyday coding

      * watching YouTube video or reading article im interested in and learning and taking notes on it. Then, maybe creating my own teachings for that info
      * Trying out the newest innovative tools early. For example, AutoGPT, etc. Then, maybe trying to find use-cases

      * Judging if some product is actually being made for the user. And figuring out the optimal way to display the product for the user. Im usually terrible at design, BUT i can almost always look at any design or finished product and know if it's good or not for the user. 
      * Im good at being a skeptic and asking why. One of my greatest skills. So this makes me good at keeping the product aligned with the vision. Also changing the vision if that is necessary. 
      * Good at and enjoy asking questions until i have complete understanding 
  * my ideal job if humans can now do whatever they want 
    * no formal job - i just do what i want whenever i want
