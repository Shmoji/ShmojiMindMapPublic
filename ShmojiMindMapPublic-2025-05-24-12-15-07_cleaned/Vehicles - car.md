  * Inspection
    * Costs $35 at Firestone
    * learned that state inspection is different from non-state inspection - no clue how to tell when what you're getting is state or not. I guess maybe "courtesy inspections" are never state or something
  * Break Fluid

    * Costs about $90 at Firestone 
  * Oil
    * Get oil change every 5000 miles
    * Costs about 80 at Pep Boy
    * Takes about 15 minutes
    * How to know if oil change is needed
      * close to oil cap, is oil dipstick (maybe colored, loop handle)
      * pull stick out and wipe end with lil notches clean with papertowel. These are max and min notches
      * stick in back in
      * If oil is getting close to lowest dot on stick OR if oil looks black on papertowel (should be transparent amber color) - you gotta get it changed
  * tire PSI
    * Q: when filling tire, should you get to your target while air is flowing in OR while reading PSI when air is not flowing in? A: when air is flowing in
  * Transmission fluid
    * It is red and as long as not real low, you're all good
