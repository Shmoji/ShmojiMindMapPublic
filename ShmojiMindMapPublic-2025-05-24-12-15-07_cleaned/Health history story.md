    * Title
      * Can you solve this medical mystery? (maybe add Mr Beast to title)
    * I'm dying. Well maybe. Based on the signals that my body sends every single waking hour of my life, my meat suit seems to be on the decline. But let me rewind a bit.
    * This is a video about my history of dealing with a chronic mysterious illness. My goal with this video is to be as authentic as possible about what my tangible experience has been like. It probably won't be a funny story and probably won't be exciting...so just a warning there. 
    * 2015. I dont remember much from this year, but I remember every once in a while I would be down bad with stomach pain. Thinking back on it, it could be due to some chronic illness, BUT it's very likely it was due to the fact that I grew up eating insanely bad almost every day. Maybe both. At that time I didn't have the slightest clue about the gut microbiome and how important it is.
    * 2016. This was the year I started university. I was so excited to escape my home town and start a new life. My own life. And I did. But that's another story. This story started about half way through my freshman year. I decided I was going to consistently workout every single week. I started getting buff. People on my dorm floor would point it out every time I wore a tank top.
    * Randomly one day after a workout, I remember feeling a tightness across my right neck. Felt like the skin was tight or something. It went from my right neck and under my right jaw a little.
    * I have no idea when it actually appeared, but after a few more days of this tightness in my neck, I actually looked at my right neck. There was a bump, about the size of a small pimple.
    * I've been to so many doctors, I absolutely cannot remember all of them, but I went and got all of this checked early. I think I was seen by university doctors first and they basically brushed me off like what i was feeling wasn't real. But then it continued for months, so I went and saw a general doctor in town. Eventually, they sent me to a specialist for ENT. After CT scans, sticking things up my nose, and drawing blood, they saw nothing wrong.
    * They had me try all kinds of drugs, mainly allergy meds, steroids, and acid reflux meds. None of them did anything for me other than cause side effects.
    * Oh and they said the bump was a lipoma. Which is not dangerous. 
    * But my right neck still felt as if someone was choking me 24/7.
    * That was the first time I ever got to the end of the professional doctor process and still had no solutions. Being new to these processes, I couldn't believe they just leave people in pain like that. Didn't even offer me options of what to do next.
    * So, I decided to just tough it out. I also decided to start eating incredibly healthy in hopes that it would fix the issues.

    * 2017-2018. These were some exciting years. My symptoms just started getting more and more complex. I started having pain and swelling on my jaw floor, on my jaw, and in the throat. Sometimes the pain would be there for no reason at about 2/10 intensity, but often during these years the pain only occurred when talking. If I tried to talk for long periods of time, it became more and more painful. Absolutely affected my ability to socialize and still does to this day.
    * This was around the first time i noticed swollen lymph nodes on my jaw floor. The lymph nodes would often uncomfortably move around when swallowing or drinking something. Kind of felt like clicking.
    * Yet again, the primary care doctor put me on every medication you can think of for a mysterious throat and jaw issue. I also started having muscle spasms and gut issues at this time.

    * Sometime during this period, I got my wisdom teeth removed. This went smoothly. Well, except when the dentist almost killed me when she pulled the tooth, dropped it down my throat, and then helped me spit it up after choking for like 5-10 seconds. I literally was laughing out loud after it happened because I couldn't believe it. Aside from that, everything went smooth.
    *  
    * I studied abroad in Japan during these years and I almost decided not to due to all these issues. I remember calling my dad at the airport when heading to Japan and telling him I was thinking about cancelling due to the symptoms I was experiencing with pain and spasms in multiple locations around my body. He told me to tough it out and I'm glad he did because despite the pain, it ended up being SO worth it.
    * But the pain limited what I could do. There was several times when our dorm in Japan went on adventurous trips, but I was in too much pain to go, so I just stayed inside and studied more. Thinking back on this, it's kind of nuts my issues were affecting my life that dramatically so long ago.

    * 2018-2019. This was my first time experiencing pain that is greater than 10/10. Pain so intense that it forces you to puke. Can you guess what caused this? Kidney stones.
    * It's possible they were formed with the help of some chronic disease, but there's no proof for that yet. However, I do know that my diet screwed me.
    * So I am a snacker. I can snack basically all day, even with big meals at the usual times. In an attempt to be healthy, I replaced all snacks with walnuts. Anytime I wasn't in class, I would be in my apartment doing homework and snacking on walnuts. In addition, I would eat sweet potatoes almost every single day with my meals. Google oxalates and look at what foods have the highest amounts of oxalates. Check out the warnings about getting too much high-oxalate foods.
    * Yup, a good way to form calcium-oxalate kidney stones. And boi did I. I formed a crap ton of them. The very first one sent me to the ER because it was so painful. I had to get it blasted out with some sort of laser. Thankfully, the rest came out naturally over the next 2 years because holy crap that laser was expensive.
    * I learned an important lesson from this experience. Everything in moderation. And also, make sure to truly do your research on things. Especially if related to health.

    * 2019-2020. Pain in my throat and jaw really started to increase, especially when talking. But it also now stayed consistent around 3/10 pain even when doing nothing.
    * Previously I experimented with changing my diet, but basically gave up because life was crazy those first years of college and the kidney stone incident scared me about messing with my diet too much. But around this time I got serious and tried experimenting in every way possible with my diet again. I made sure to do very in-depth research this time around, so that I didn't eat too much of one thing. I found the only diet that really helped was eating mostly beans, veggies, and occasionally meat. So, if you lived with me, almost every day you would see that most of my meals were just a bowl filled with beans, rice, and veggies. If i stuck with that for weeks straight, my symptoms would slightly decrease. But it was not a permanent fix.
    * I also noticed that gluten did indeed cause my body to hurt, so I cut that out, which wasn't hard. And I cut out added sugar too. That's something easy that everyone can do, so I said why not.
    * I started logging down all my issues around this time in a digital notebook. I didn't do a great job at logging everything until much later, but I did manage to get some data down around this time.

    * Sometime around 2019 i started experiencing chest pains that sent me to the doctor multiple times. I specifically remember sitting at my computer one day and randomly felt like I got electrocuted from the tips of my left fingers to my left chest. After it happened, pain and a tingly-feeling lingered there for multiple days. I experienced these type of chest and arm symptoms multiple times, but they were kind of rare. There seems to be no consistency with them, EXCEPT that if i eat extremely healthy, then they don't happen. I think these symptoms just further confuse things, so I typically don't mention them.
    * Same thing with the gut issues. As long as i strictly eat healthy for a long period of time, I don't get any gut issues. 
    * So, the main focus at this point was pain around the jaw and throat. There are various other symptoms with spasming muscles, chest pain, and gut pain, but they all seemed to be less serious.

    * 2020 stayed about the same, just increased pain. 5/10 pain was consistent for me now. I graduated this year, so now I was working a job and had money. Due to this, I began seeing doctors multiple times every week. I was incredibly serious about getting this figured out. I didn't care how much I needed to spend.
    * Although, there was one new issue that arised in 2020. A varicocele. Confirmed from an ultrasound. It's basically when your vein down in the groin area is not functioning properly. The blood pools for some reason. That caused a tremendous amount of pain and I saw tons of doctors. I almost had the surgery for it, but I'm so glad i didn't. I found that if I eat a really strict diet over long periods of time, then I don't typically have any varicocele pain. Also, acupuncture helps a lot with varicoceles for some reason. If you do research on varicoceles, they are quite a mystery. Doctors can tell you at a very small level what is causing it. It's caused by the valves in the veins not working. But that's not a real answer. Why did I go from not having a varicocele my whole life, to having one. And then why does a strict diet fix it for me? Doctors dont have answers for this. We're just not that far into the future yet apparently.

    * 2021-2022, I started having sinus issues. It was confirmed chronic sinusitis, whatever that blanket statement even means.
    * It started sometime in 2021 and is now consistent to this day. In the beginning, it was just pressure at the upper part of my nose. Then, it became pain too.
    * A red “rash” started small on one side of my nose. Back in the day this red spot would come and go. However, this eventually became permanent and spread to both sides of the nose. It doesn't really look like a butterfly rash and it’s not super prominent, so doctors have nothing to say about it. 

    * Over time, just like the pain in my jaw and throat, this sinus pain became consistent, even when not talking. Often the pain is felt in the sinuses under the eyes too, but the main point seems to be at the top of the nose.
    * That area at the top of the nose also felt a burning sensation. Like sunburn under the skin. One day, the burning sensation traveled from the upper nose to the entire head. This comes in waves, but has not gone away fully since then. I remember this day vividly because it sent me to the ER and even if you don't remember, your wallet is going to remember all the visits to an American ER.
    * As soon as this feeling started happening on my head, i began losing my hair pretty quickly. Basically anytime i take a shower, i lose clumps of hair, which never happened in the past. My hairline has always been pretty darn good and ever since this symptom, it is getting worse and worse. Bit of a bummer.
    * One day, that burning skin feeling traveled around my body and now it is common anywhere. But it tends to focus on certain spots like forearms and back of the neck, while remaining consistent on the head and upper nose.

    * In 2022, I started experiencing chronic fatigue and muscle weakness all the time. Made it very hard to work, even as a developer who just sits in a chair all day.
    * At this point, it was rare to be able to workout anymore. One day I tried doing my old workout where i do 3 sets of pushups. I barely did any at all and I ended up sore for over a month. While recovering, I would start feeling like the soreness had gone away and then randomly the next day, I'm even more sore again. It felt as if my muscles would heal and then the healing would get undone somehow.

    * Another weird symptom appeared that just doesn't make much sense. I started having eye pain on occasion. No consistency to it at all. One time my eyes hurt so bad that it felt like both were very badly bruised. After that incident, I developed a floater in my left eye that never went away.

    * So I know at this point, you're probably incredibly confused, just like i am. But there's a few other events and symptoms I feel is necessary to mention. Then, I will explain some of the different things I've tried in order to solve whatever is happening to me.

    * In 2022, i got covid for the first time. It really wasn't that bad, even being unvaccinated. It mainly just made my body sore and weak, which is how my body is most of the time anyways. HOWEVER, 3 days after i was done with covid, i started peeing blood. Like straight blood for over a week. Doctors couldn't do all that much for me. Their best guess was that dehydration caused a kidney stone. And they were right that it was indeed a stone. Of course i made that discovery after intense puking from pain and yet another fun ER visit.
    * I found this situation slightly weird because i went a little less than 24 hours with very little water, which I did all the time when i was a kid. But somehow this time it created a kidney stone. Are stones created from dehydration also calcium oxalate stones like those that formed from my bad diet? Just seems a bit odd to me and maybe points to some chronic issue that hasn't been discovered yet. Something that makes more sense than just "chronic kidney stones". Like a real reason.

    * Sometime during 2022, I visited a Dermatologist and learned that the bump on my right neck is not a lipoma, it is actually an epidermoid cyst, which is still not dangerous. However, nowadays it is almost double or triple the size it was in 2016.

    * One day I let my parents look down my throat and they saw little red bumps on my throat near my tonsils. So that's another signal. Maybe I need my tonsils removed or something. Or it's just normal, i have no idea.

    * In addition, recently I've been noticing that the pain around my jaw and throat and sinuses will get very very intense, until randomly the pain decreases. Then, i feel some liquid slide down my throat. 
    * Often, this liquid or mucus tastes sweet. Really sounds like an infection doesn't it?
    * And to add to that, i often get the smell of smoke randomly in my nose, which signals an infection even more i would think.

    * In terms of my health history, the only other thing I have to add is that my pain levels are pretty consistent around 8/10 intensity nowadays, with the main issues being pain in the jaw floor, throat, and sinuses. Then, all the other symptoms just add a cherry on top.

    * So that's the history; now let's talk about all the different things I've tried in order to figure this mess out. 

    * In order to fix the sinus issues, doctors have tried putting me on 2 different antibiotics. Amoxycillin and doxycycline. Neither seemed to do anything except cause side effects. 
    * I have tried seeing ENTs, Speech Pathologist, Allergists, Neurologist, and many other doctors.
    * I have tried acupuncture, body talk, meditation, spirituality, and more.
    * I have got CTs and MRIs of the entire spine and head. CTs of the abs and chest.
    * I have had my teeth completely checked.

    * So what diagnosis have me and my doctors considered?

    * The answer is literally everything. We've checked for autoimmune conditions, tick-born illnesses, yeast infections, almost every blood test you can think of, various urine tests, and multiple stool tests.

    * I had a TMJ disorder specialist check and they said I do not have any issues with TMJ. However, I saw another dentist and he said the pain that I feel is exactly the pain associated with a TMJ disorder. He thinks if I got invisalign and fixed my deep over bite, it would most likely solve the majority of the pain in my jaw and throat. I'm still skeptical, but I'm most certainly going to try it.

    * My ENT really has no idea, but he is thinking there is a possibility of a stone in my salivary gland. He thought about this after noticing how tinder the salivary glands under my tongue were. He said if the stone is not calcified it will not show up on a CT scan and even if it is calcified, it still would not show up. However, stones usually cause local swelling in a certain area. I do not have this and my pain is pretty equal on both sides of the jaw.

    * What diagnosis am i considering right now?

    * I genuinely have no idea. But if I had to guess, it's some sort of sneaky chronic infection, a dysfunction of the immune system, or it's a TMJ disorder due to bad teeth positioning causing my jaw bones and muscles to be screwed. That's my best guess.

    * Now i have some very far-out-there guesses too, so I'll mention those. 

    * Sometime around later middle school or early highschool, which was around 2012, I had a tooth pulled. This tooth was infected for almost 2 years, which is obviously not good. I remember spending so much time sleeping because my entire jaw and face was killing me from the infection. Sometimes I wonder if having that infection for so long screwed me up chronically somehow.
    * Sometime around 2016, i spent many months in a room that had a hole in the ceiling. Often, there was a mildew smell from this hole and it even dripped whenever it rained. So, maybe I somehow got some sort of chronic illness from mold long ago that still lingers with me nowadays.
    * Sometime between 2012 and 2016, I would spend weeks and weeks practicing what is called fry screaming because I wanted to be the vocalist in a metal band. I remember it actually hurting, so i obviously was not using a healthy technique. Maybe i messed something up by spending so much time fry screaming. Funny to think about, but who knows, maybe.

    * So, as you can tell, this bull crap affects my life drastically in various ways.
    * My social life has taken a huge hit. It's incredibly difficult to spend time talking to people, when movements of the face physically hurt. This social disadvantage has affected everything from my professional life, to my personal content, to my romantic life, and more. It's pretty wack.
    * I am a traveler, but I've been stuck because I'm in too much pain to travel and it's scary to think what will happen if an emergency happens away from home. Most weekends I have to cancel on friends because im in too much pain to even travel 15 minutes down the road.
    * I absolutely love exercise, but I can no longer do that due to reasons explained earlier. 
    * If you have chonic pain, you know there's countless ways you will be effected emotionally. 
    * And of course, you will be insanely financially screwed by a chronic illness. I have spent 10s of thousands. Most people spend extra money on food, clothing, gifts...but the majority of mine is siphoned away by the medical system. It's pretty great.

    * And that is my health story. If you watched this whole thing, i hope you don't leave feeling depressed. While this situation sucks, it's also built me into one hell of a person. I want to get this thing figured out and resolved, but I know that may never happen.  And that's okay.
    * Through the extreme and consistent pain, I've learned to find love and meaning in every single moment. I can even love the pain and suffering.
    * Life can stay amazing, no matter how bad your RNG is.


  * For pasting into docs input forms
    * Please describe your health history
      * It will be much better to watch video of my history. I'll paste that at the end of this. Here is summarized text version: Experienced stomach pain in 2015, potentially due to chronic illness or poor diet. Developed a bump on the right neck, diagnosed as a lipoma. Experienced tightness and pain in the neck, consulted doctors and underwent various tests without finding a cause or solution. Started experiencing pain and swelling in the jaw, throat, and chest, along with muscle spasms and gut issues. Studied abroad in Japan, but pain limited participation in activities. Developed kidney stones likely due to a diet high in oxalates and maybe certain fungi. Pain in the throat and jaw increased, experimented with diet changes, gluten and added sugar were cut out. Started experiencing chest pains and varicocele pain in the groin area. Developed chronic sinusitis and experienced pain, pressure, and a rash on the nose. Burning sensation in the upper nose, head, and other body parts. Experienced chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty working out. Developed eye pain and floater in the left eye. Identified an epidermoid cyst on the right neck instead of a lipoma. Noticed red bumps near the tonsils and experienced intense pain followed by the sensation of liquid or mucus sliding down the throat, sometimes tasting sweet. That's a very basic summary.

    * health history in under 1000 words in format of a story by GPT
      * Back in 2015, I began to experience some unsettling health issues. It started with occasional stomach pain, not sure if it was due to a chronic illness or simply my poor dietary choices at that time. Little did I know this was just the beginning of a perplexing journey of symptoms.
      * As time went on, a bump appeared on the right side of my neck at the same time that I started experiencing tightness in the same location. Seeking medical advice, I was informed that it was a lipoma, which initially provided some relief. However, the discomfort in my neck persisted, and I couldn't shake off the tightness and pain that accompanied it. Frustratingly, no matter how many doctors I consulted or tests I underwent, we couldn't pinpoint a cause or find a solution to the symptoms. The doctors agreed the symptoms I felt would not be caused by a small lipoma.
      * To make matters worse, my condition continued to deteriorate. The pain and swelling spread to my jaw, throat, and chest, accompanied by muscle spasms and troublesome gut issues. These symptoms became so severe that they significantly impacted my experience while studying abroad in Japan. Participating in activities became a struggle as the pain limited my ability to fully engage and enjoy my time abroad and in any activity.
      * Amidst the ongoing challenges, I was hit with another blow—kidney stones. It seemed they were the result of a diet high in oxalates and perhaps my exposure to certain fungi. The pain intensified, compounding the complexities of my already troubled health.
      * I started experimenting with dietary changes. I eliminated gluten and added sugar from my meals, hoping it would alleviate some of my discomfort. Cutting out these elements did provide some respite from the pain in my throat and jaw. However, it was not a permanent solution.
      * Chest pains and the additional pain of a varicocele in my groin area started plaguing me. I was then confronted with chronic sinusitis, which brought along its own set of challenges. Pain, pressure, and a rash on my nose added to the torment I endured daily. It felt as if a burning sensation had taken hold not just in my upper nose and head but also in various parts of my body, leaving me yearning for answers and relief...as usual.
      * Chronic fatigue, muscle weakness, and the inability to engage in regular exercise became a frustrating reality. My once active lifestyle was now hindered by an overwhelming sense of physical exhaustion and weakness.
      * I also began to experience eye pain, along with a floater in my left eye. It was yet another addition to the growing list of health issues that plagued me.
      * And so, my story continues, as I persistently navigate this journey, hoping for answers, relief, and the restoration of my once vibrant and healthy self.
