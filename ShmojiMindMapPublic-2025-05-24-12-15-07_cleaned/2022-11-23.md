    * I noticed when i was talking to my gparents that i have to spend a TON of energy to simplify what I'm talking about so they can understand. If I don't, they just have no idea what I'm talking about. I feel i may do this in most interactions. What if i dont? What if i don't fit the information coming out of me with what i think will make sense to the person im talking to. Let's be more aware of this so i can control whether i limit myself or not
  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * I took epsom salt bath today. After done, my jaw/throat pain defs felt better. Also, i had sweet taste in my throat. Not sure if from lavender or from infection in throat dying.
    * Noticed I have 4 bumps under my tongue. I think they are Wharton's Ducts, the openings to salivary glands. However, mine seem swollen based on pics i looked up. Maybe not tho. Sialadenitis refers to a swollen salivary gland. It's caused by infections, autoimmune diseases and salivary gland stones.
