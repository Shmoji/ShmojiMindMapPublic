  * tracking learning pressure, volume, density, liters
    * [[2024-11-22]] is it true that a liter of one substance is different than a liter of another substance #memo
      * WHAT IS A LITER, HALFGAL MILK 1.89L, CALORIE: i started wondering about this liter stuff bc i learned about calories and how the half-gal milks are about 1.8L and that much water (1L) is about kg and that much heated by 1 degree C represents 1 kilocalorie. Then i reconfirmed that grams are mass lol. okay so 1000g of WATER is 1L...but learned not same for all substances...and got confused. So im like, what is a liter?
      * HOW IS LITERS/VOLUME RELATED TO BP: i kinda related all this liter stuff back to pressure bc of learnings on blood volume and affects on blood pressure. More volume/space of blood = more pressure bc volume/space of blood vessels tubes constant (except vasodilation) - packing more substance in blood vessel's volume/space - blood volume inside bloodvessel volume. Density wording gets confusing in terms of blood so dont worry too much, but density of blood DECREASES with more volume, but density of "substance INSIDE about-constant-volume vessel relative to that unchanging vessel-volume" does basically increase as blood volume increases - but wording sucks and usually just described as PRESSURE instead. me: usually when talking of density/volume, ur talking about a specific/clear substance like blood...so when you talk about a combo of substances (like blood and vessels) it can get more complex (dont get too stuck on dis lol)
      * Q: is it true that a liter of one substance is different than a liter of another substance?
        * actually INCORRECT. mass/density per liter can be different tho. 1000g of water per L vs 1234g of plutonium per L lol
        * OG stuck point at beginning was due to density, not volume lol. both mass and density of substance INSIDE liter can change, but liter/volume CANNOT change - iz space bb
      * Q: what is a liter?
        * unit for volume
        * 1 liter = **1 cubic decimeter (1 dm^3)**
        * CUBIC: means the 3 sides/unique-dimensions of cube/whatever are each whatever the amount and unit says
        * ### Breaking it Down:
          * FOR ME: inch is about top part of thumb. lil less than half of that inch is CM. 10cm=1dm...and 10cm is about 4in...which you know how to remember that lol
          * **1 decimeter (dm)** = 10 centimeters (cm)
            * **Deci-** means one-tenth - while centi mean one-hundredth - they are an order of magnitude apart
          * A cubic decimeter (dm^3 is a cube with each side equal to 10cm/1dm)
            * 1 dm^3=10 cm×10 cm×10 cm=1000 cm^3
            * can imagine shape as dingdong in 3 dimensions OR lil cubic 1cm cubes - each dimension going from 0 to 10; then they fill to be 1000 in total
            * my intuition feels like liter is smaller than i thought, but nope daz it - i never see in cube form usually
          * Q: why does multiplying only 3 sides of cube give volume?
            * each side has same value in cube, BUT 3 unique dimensions based on identity/axis - combining units of each axis allows you to get volume. you start with 1D of 10 1cm coobs, becomes 2D 100 1cm coobs, then 3D 1000 1cm coobs (multiplication does this process quick)
            * start with 2D monitor: if you have width and height - you can follow from 0 to end of those 2 distances and then find where the 2 ends converge which tells entire area (obv diff for different shapes)
            * for 3D cube iz same thing: start from 0 point. then travel from 0 to end of width, end of height, end of depth. Now find where those converge
            * NOTE: how those converge together to form complete shape requires knowledge of whatever shape it is
            * another **Visualizing the Multiplication**:
              * Imagine you have a stack of **10 rows**, where each row is a **10 cm × 10 cm** square (100 total per square). If you stack 10 such rows on top of each other, you get a cube with volume:
              * Volume=10×10×10=1000 cm^3
              * this makes sense to me bc you're multiplying 10 2D (10by10) squares to create coob
        * Q: what is volume?
          * THE 3D SPACE: amount of **space** occupied by an object or substance. It’s a three-dimensional measure that describes how much "room" something takes up in a given space.
          * i think of as lil 3D object...but actually is space that gets filled with objects
          * FILLING: when talking about "filling" volume, iz more about the mass of objects than the material of objects themself btw
        * FIGURING OUT DIFF IN VOLUME vs DENSITY: BUT i also imagine solvent like water and you just easily add more salt to it which increases mass, yet the volume/liter stays same. EX: obv if multiple substances in a solvent (when thinking of like a food label), youd be able to add them up to get 1L and total grams/mass per L...which is density lol (key learning: is not always 1 substance filling 1L)
        * Q: what is density?
          * mass per volume/3Dobject
          * you can think of mass as amount of material, but that doesnt hold true super well
          * DENSITY relates mass to volume. it is mass/volume (g/L) - note that this unit for density abstract cubic part of volume away
          * i like to think of density as concentration or stuffing mass/something inside some SPACE (and volume helps unit-ize the SPACE of some real object)
        * mass fills space differently based on tons of differing factors. So sometimes you can add more grams/mass and volume of 1L stays same despite more mass...well, volume always stays same, but i guess you could imagine more units of volume manifesting or spilling out at certain mass/density threshold (altho iz more like substance spilling out to a different unit volume lolz)
          * blood volume is good example for this: when blood volume increases, there's more units of volume/L. in real-world, may be hard to know when you have more mass/g vs more volume/L from changes ur observing and where the limit is where more mass starts becoming more volume instead of increasing mass number (dont get too stuck on dis lel)
    * [[2024-11-26]] mmHg, what da tube called, what allows uniform pressure in air and water but then what actually generates uniform pressure #memo
      * unit **mm Hg** stands for **millimeters of mercury**, which is a standard unit for measuring pressure
      * P=F/A
      * it means you start with 1) top-open container of some liquid (water or Hg) and 2) upsidedown vacuum tube called **barometer** (with open/close top) filled with Hg. Open the upsidedown tube top and then the force from AIR pressure is put on Hg pushing it towards vacuum (vice versa Hg pushes on AIR away from/creating vacuum). This raises the mercury up in container (leaving vacuum space in barometer) and distance from bottom of container to edge of fallen Hg/vacuum gives whatever mm like 120 - thaz da numbah
      * Width of tube doesnt actually matter, height/mm will be exact same between tubes of different width. Assume both tubes start filled, so there's enough liquid
        * tldr: TOTAL force would be different between 2 tubes, but pressure (force per unit area) is same. Newton's 3rd law still happy yay. despite TOTAL forces being different, we measuring pressure...so we just dont care bruh
        * meme for N3: the 3 looks equal and opposite...
        * Q: so if you applied a really strong force to this experiment and then for another setup you apply really weak force (to replace air), would pressure of Hg still end up the same?
          * YES, if pressures behind those forces were same despite such drastic total force differences.
        * reminds me of radiant energy (total force) vs photon energy tied to frequency (pressure)
      * basically: liquid level in tube decreases (as it flows out, leaving vacuum behind) until pressure of LIQUID is SAME as pressure from AIR (forces cancelling...thanks N 3rd Law)
      * Q: why does the air pressure outside balance with pressure of Hg?
        * because **fluids (gases and liquids) always seek equilibrium**...my guess is due to energy minimization - trying to reach minimal/stable energy state
        * GPT: The height of the mercury column adjusts so that the **pressure at the base of the column equals the atmospheric pressure** acting on the surface of the mercury in the dish.
      * NOTE: at room temp, mercury is always liquid
      * TOXIC: stopped using Hg in 2007 due to toxicity
      * VACUUM: basically the vacuum allows you to measure the pressure of liquid/substance nice. if air was there it no work. Vacuum ensures there is **no air pressure** pushing down on the mercury column from above - which would interfere with measurement of pressure. But with vacuum, only AIR PRESSURE (which IS different depending where u are) is only force acting on liquid/substance. So mm is useful for quickly telling you how pressure of air changes liquid and vice versa
        * vacuum leaves space to say: hey, we're just measuring this substance
        * my best guess: bc vacuum appears and nothing else acting on substance, this allows you to measure it precisely in units - hence force per unit area/pressure is what ends up represented by the height/mm
        * you cant quantize/unit-ize some substance if ur measuring other substances too! which would be the case if extra air or whatever was there instead of vacuum
        * think it also helps that air pressure is uniform. We dont know total force of AIR lol but we know the pressure - and then can use that to measure pressure of other substances NICE
        * my brain hurts trying to understand why the height ends up being measure for pressure and not TOTAL force, but what helps is knowing that WIDTH of tube didnt matter in observations, which then leads to brain no hurt anymore. in this setup with a vacuum, the control mechanism for distributing the substance is controlled by JUST pressure (mainly bc vacuum and N's 3rd Law i think). Between both inside system (liquid/substance/Hg) and outside pressures (air). Helps to realize pressure is often (especially static air and liquids) uniform in all directions and GRAVITY causes pressure gradient as you go further towards center of Earth due to less volume as going to center
      * Q: okay...where does pressure of Hg come from? imagine you had that mercury tube floating out in space, where does the mercury's pressure come from?
        * both air pressure and gravity. Q: so is pressure of mercury on earth coming from gravity or from air presure?
          * both. In fact, pressure of everything ORIGINATES from gravity, including air.
          * **Atmospheric Pressure** is a direct consequence of **gravity** pulling the atmosphere down towards Earth (center of mass). As substances like air get closer to center of earth, there is less volume for that substance, higher density, higher pressure
          * **The Pressure of Mercury in a Barometer** comes from:
            * **Atmospheric Pressure** (which air is held together due to gravity and causes air to be denser closer to CoM), pushing the mercury up. BUT air pressure is omnidirectional because the molecular collisions that define pressure occur randomly in every direction. so gravity sets up conditions, but uniform pressures primarily GENERATED by molecular collisions in all directions
            * **Gravity** on the mercury/mass itself, pulling/accelerating it down. Hg pressure is concentrated inside barometer unlike air (pressure is just from gravity for Hg)
            * tldr: just gravity acting on mercury/mass. gravity sets up AIR by acting on air, but air pressure is separate from that (omnidirectional movement of molecules) and is what acts on mercury/mass (altho gravity is what creates pressure gradient...so not totes separate)
        * in space: barometer cant measure in space due to absence of gravity field or big ol mass of Earth - nothing accelerating Hg mass
          * **Pressure Source in space** (skim):
            * **Surface Tension**: In the absence of significant external forces, the primary pressure within the mercury would come from its own surface tension. Mercury, like all liquids, has surface tension, which would cause it to form into spheres or blobs in zero gravity. This surface tension creates a kind of "internal pressure" where the mercury maintains its shape against the vacuum of space.
            * **Cohesion & Adhesion**: The mercury might cling to the walls of the tube due to adhesion forces, but without gravity, there wouldn't be a defined column of mercury in the barometer as seen on Earth.
            * **Internal Molecular Forces**: The pressure inside the mercury would be due to molecular interactions, essentially the forces between mercury atoms that keep it in a liquid state. These are not pressures in the sense of atmospheric or gravitational pressure but rather the intrinsic pressure associated with any liquid's existence.
          * Q: couldnt a planet without air still have pressure if it had gravity?
            * YES. gravitational pressure. This isn't pressure in the atmospheric sense but rather the force per unit area that an object would experience due to gravity. (it is basically uniform BUT bc gravity, iz only in one direction towards CoM)
            * interesting examples:
              * **Moon**: The Moon has gravity but no significant atmosphere. There's no atmospheric pressure on the Moon's surface, but objects there experience gravitational force, which could be considered a form of "pressure" if you're thinking about the force applied on a SURFACE.
              * **Mercury (the planet)**: It has a very thin atmosphere, so while there is some atmospheric pressure, it's negligible. The primary "pressure" you'd consider is the gravitational force on objects, not atmospheric pressure.
      * memo notes
        * [[2024-12-12]]
          * did not mem off top of head to remembuh term barometer
          * i forgot apple example was 1J despite remembering it is 1N woah (some reason i remembered 60J of incandescent bulb)
          * i forgot lbf to N conversions nice
          * added meme of atm being 14psi which is about half of tire psi
          * WIND Q that you start to notice as scary and def feel, NEAR GALE FORCE (Whole trees in motion, noticeable pressure on structures): 28mph = 12.5m/s is about 96Pa (or just 100). 28mph is considered strong breeze. i relate to this from life...now imagine MaxQ of 30kPa on you... (and how static pressure of 101kPa is totes fine...until change of about 20kPa). Just double this speed and you get: SOME trees broken or uprooted, considerable structural damage. dPressure is scury lol
          * mph and knots are about same. 1mph = 0.86knots

    * [[2024-12-12]] what iz Pa and meter to feet, gauge vs absolute, what iz all pressure units, my foot vs 1atm, what iz maxQ,   pressure gradient and density as closer to center of mass of Earth...and this tied to WATER #memo
      * JUS A UNIT: nowadays mmHg iz more of just a unit bc obv we can measure pressure in better ways now - and in space where no AIR
        * 1 pascals (Pa) = 1N/m^2
        * 1 meter = 3.28feet
      * me trying to find more intuitive way to think of mmHg - this is how i will imagine it when seeing mmHg/pressure from now prob
        * Lifting a small apple (about 100 grams) one meter vertically against gravity uses about **1 joule** of energy and requires about 1N of force (f=ma, 0.1kg*9.8m/s^2=0.98N). make acc 1 and 1kg and thaz also 1N
        * learning about pounds:
          * WEIGHT IS A FORCE: in everyday language, weight is often confused with mass. Weight is a force (hence measured in lbf), while mass is a measure of the amount of matter (measured in lb or kg). On Earth, one pound-mass (lb) experiences a force of one pound-force (lbf) due to gravity acc (32 ft/s²) - 1lb*32ft/s^2=1lbf
          * NOTE: iz rare to hear poundmass (lb) ever - but on EARTH, lb and lbf are about always equal anyways
          * metric system twin: 1kg×9.81m/s^2=9.81N
          * ON MOON: 120 me would still have 120lbm, but would be 20lbf (moon gravity is 1/6 of Earth's) - and lbf is one we all use lol
        * lbf to N conversions (mainly just worry about memoing the memes and not the other nums)
          * meme: makes sense bc about times 4 my 120 is 529N. so there's more force per lbf than per N
          * 1lbf=4.44N (will discuss diff in lbf and lb later)
          * 1N=0.22lbf
        * lb to kg conversions: (lb and lbf same on Earth, so dont worry bout dat)
          * meme: makes sense bc about double my kg is 120. so there's more mass per kg than per lbm
          * 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds (approximately) - ooo 1kg weighs more
          * 1 pound ≈ 0.45 kilograms
          * kg to lb: just multiply kg by 2.2 (double it basically and add lil more)
          * lb to kg: just multiply lb by 0.45 (half it basically and minus lil more)
        * psi (pound-force per square inch)
          * realization: your weight on scale is lbf too (so cant just use simple lbmass to kgmass conversion i know)...but also on EARTH lbf and lbm almost always equal lol
          * tire pressure almost always GUAGE pressure
        * Gauge Pressure vs. Absolute Pressure (meme: ALL pressure)
          * gauge P tells P WITHOUT air pressure - absolute tells P with air P. My TCorolla2015 set P to 32psi. Cool comparing this to PofFoot lol
        * good membuhin ex: standing on ONE foot vs 2 feet. same force from your weight, but different pressures
          * very approximately a human foot is 2 square cm (small, but close). so both feet are 4 cm^2 (cm is lil less than half an inch)
          * i am 54kg (120lbf). F=m⋅g=54kg⋅9.8m/s^2=529N (basically converted from imperial force to metric force lol)
          * P(both feet) = F/A = 529.2N/4cm^2 = 13230Pa
          * this pressure DOUBLES with one foot, yet same force...but you FEEL pressure difference. 1 foot = 26460Pa
          * 26kPa = 3.84psi = 198.48mmHg
          * someone standing on ur back with ONE foot hurts more than same person standing on back with TWO feet (2 feet distributes total force across more area making less painful, diff concentration of force per area)
          * force of air on you at sealevel 101kPa is more than force on you due to my one foot 26kPa, BUT air is uniformly distributed in every direction around your body and all force cancels out. Foot pressure is concentrated in small area, so hurts despite uniformly distributed in that tiny area
          * WOAH COOL TYING BACK IN TO ERRTHING: my foot coming from 120lbf/54kg/529N body places 26 kPa (like dude robot's body), which is 3.84psi (tied to 32psi of 1 my corolla tire), which is 198mmHg tied to healthy systolic BP of 120mmHg and healthy diastolic BP of 80. Less blood volume when i get drained means less mass/substance of blood which means less pressure/force from that bloodmass on vessels. MaxQ usually about 30kPa (not with staticP added). 1atm/ATA/bar is about 101kPa/14psi (meme: almost half psi of my TIRE). Q much less uniform and more scury tho.
          * Q: what is unit of atm/atmosphere, ATA, and bar?
            * 1 atm is standard atmospheric pressure at sea level, approximately equal to 101 kPa or 14 psi...ooo the pressure on you by air RN is more than my 1 foot lol
            * ATA is absolute version of atm. Usually assumed atm is absolute (more than JUST air pressure) and not gauge pressure of air, but ATA makes even more clear which can be important when underwater
            * bar is just another unit lol. **1 atm = 1.01325 bar**. 1 bar = exactly 100kPa which is nice. seems bars used in practical engineering apps more often than atm
          * Q: what is MaxQ or max dynamic pressure?
            * PEAK stress point on rocket: basically on all pieces of it on outside tbh
            * different than gauge pressure. More about static P vs dynamic P. Dynamic is pressure exerted due to MOVEMENT of a substance
            * when rocket going UP, there is maxQ and iz different for each rocket bc rocket is object causing air to move (and exert dynamic/movement pressure). Wind doesnt affect nearly as much, but also adds to Q.
            * MaxQ occurs when the rocket reaches a certain speed and altitude, typically around 10 km where the static pressure is about 25 kPa (compared to 101kPa at sea level), combined with a dynamic pressure of approximately 30 kPa, making a total of 55 kPa (compared to my foot of 26kPa). This is a critical point for structural integrity testing during flight. (crazy bc just 30kPa of dynamic P is dangerous, but 101kPa of static P is not, and 100Pa of wind is gettin close to gale force,12.5m/s,28mph)
            * Q: TOTAL pressure when rocket first launches will be much higher than TOTAL pressure at maxQ? A: yes (sometimes not much, sometimes only a lil tho)
            * Why MaxQ is Still SO CRUCIAL: at launch, the static pressure is mostly uniform so less stress (like air on you). Dynamic pressure results in **asymmetric stresses** and **asymmetric aerodynamic loads** (drag, lift, bending, etc.). These forces can deform or damage the rocket if not properly accounted for. asymmetric is key word (imagine EX of same depth under ocean, yet differing pressure. or imagine feeling of wind on your umbrella as walking to class in Boone)
            * DPressure creates the largest aerodynamic stresses due to asymmetric stress and max is at MaxQ bb
          * BUOYANCY: floating in water is literally caused by pressure gradient woah!! (bc substance is more dense thanks to gravity packing it in small volume towards CoM and pressure from below is higher and has force UP on you)
        * Not all pressure is uniform in all directions. For BP, kinda thinking of force on some spot of blood vessel from causal chain originating from pump of heart (always thinking about mass accelerating PER unit area). So direction primarily due to heart pump - but also many other factors not gonna memo
        * but to calculate values, i dont think you even need to know area above. you can just go from pressure to TOTAL force and vice versa. TOTAL force felt from air isn't the weight of the air above you but how it's balanced by the pressure around you. While gravity is in one direction, static pressure is in all directions, so total force of that is not what is stacked on top of you. Depends on example whether is in all directions or not - like BP is not all directions bc heartpump creating OG force - but air and liquid in all directions on you (with equal force back on air from you)
          * NOTE: these numbers basically wrong, but the point still stands
          * TOTAL force on person due to air is LARGE (86k N in down direction at sealevel), especially compared to their weight (force due to gravity force, im 529N)
          * NOTE: 86kN likely very very rough to point of being wrong, but gives point that many forces in diff directions and downward is biggest
          * 86K comes from P*m^2 = 101kPa*1.7m^2(human area)=172k N and half is 86kN - about half of total force goes down and rest goes in other directions. For weight, we only care about down. Weight is not contained in this **total force on you from air**, but an additional N - 529N/120lb of weight - just force from humanMass * gravAcceleration
          * Q: so most TOTAL force on you at sealevel is from air pressure and not gravity force?
            * YES. Diff in 529N and 86kN. 
            * HOWEVER, while air pressure exerts a much higher total force on you than gravity, in terms of what you perceive as "weight," it's the gravitational force alone that you feel since the air pressure is evenly distributed and counteracted completely in various ways around body (cancelling forces). NOTE: iz distributed and not in stack of air above body, but at boundary of body and air
        * Q: when do YOU start feeling pain/difference from pressure AND when do YOU feel danger/injury?
          * pain: ~0.2atm/20kPa/3psi/152mmHg above or below normal pressure like 101kPa at sealevel
          * danger: >4ata/405kPa/58psi/3kmmHg external pressure (deep diving risks) - NOTE: dis for static pressure tho, not dynamic lol
        * reminds me similar to 1 point of efield - representing force on a point due to all other forces/points in efield. except this is force on a AREAunit by all causal units/force (mainly originating from force and mass). i imagine 1) swimming deep down and lower hurts more (harder to breath) bc da force chain 2) point on blood vessel feeling force due to both the pump and due to mass of all substances of blood
