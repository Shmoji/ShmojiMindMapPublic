  * GPT plugins
    * Diagram it
      * how does it work generally?
        * You enter an idea (it can be pretty abstract) and then it will create a diagram based on that idea
    * Video Insights ^vGWg29sTJ
      * what you can do with it:
        * get transcript of any video (most supports YT rn)
        * get summary of any video
    * WebPilot ^BeIILpEga
      * what it do?
        * You can get answers for any web page.
  * end thoughts / what da value?
    * This is huge. This basically makes it so ChatGPT can take your API and use it without frontend devs even writing code to consume it. Which leads me to this question: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ChatGPT Plugins#^JBBozvIcO|Can these plugins be used with just ChatGPT UI or can it be used with GPT in general? I ask because that means i no longer need to integrate APIs into my frontends...GPT can just do it for me.]]
    * my project ideas
      * i could use plugin for My Desires Project
        * User says "ADD desire. ADD blocker to desire x. Add plans to desire X. Show all my desires." I still think my own separate UI is prob better idea tho. Too many limits to ChatGPT chatbot UI.

    * personal
      * i could increase my productivity like crazy. create API to store notes instead of long Roam process. Same for fetching my own data
        * Tho, may need to worry about GPT having my data
  * questions
    * These plugins have to be hosted...but why and how does that work?
      * i think it's just the API you create obv needs to be hosted somewhere
    * Can these plugins be used with just ChatGPT UI or can it be used with GPT in general? I ask because that means i no longer need to integrate APIs into my frontends...GPT can just do it for me. ^JBBozvIcO
