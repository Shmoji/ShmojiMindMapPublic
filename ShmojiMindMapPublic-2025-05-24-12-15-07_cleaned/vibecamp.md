    * tracking thoughts on running an event
      * [[2024-05-07]]
        * maybe could have a big location. Here there is a specific location for JOINABLE PEOPLE and FOR NON-JOINABLE PEOPLE. There is a specific box where you can place index cards of things you need help with OR desires. HELPERS will wear a certain thing to indicate they are a helper (mainly for people confident enough to reach out for help).
        * so there are no hard rules aside from locations. But ALSO they can optionally use my app to make things even more clear
      * [[2024-05-23]]
        * maybe i can make slogan of event: "do your own thing and vibe". or "enabling parallel play" - and that's it. Then i can just do my own thing, which is of course my project. And ill of course tell people and show im using it at VC and if others wanna use it too, then they can
        * i imagine simple real-time ui like in jazz tools demo - except it is just feed of people posting desires and help requests
        * people can be anon or not - but hard for people to help if ur anon
        * hard thing: how to find the people if you dont know them
          * maybe people can react with "i can help or try to help"
          * maybe ui can encourage people to describe what they look like if they want people to find them
          * or maybe they can put X account or their number for people to message them and find each other
        * if desire or help request is satisfied, people can mark it done so it goes away
        * i can shill my idea a lil maybe with the event/container too
        * idea i like: have premade buttons for stuff like:
          * i want to chat
            * i want to chat about ___
            * i want to socialize but dont know how or see no opportunities
          * i am bored and have no idea what to do
        * difference in this and parallel context?
          * i think this idea will not really try to incorporate emotes at all...i guess?
          * uncertain if "all people in this context", "helpers", and "joinable people" will be a thing or not
            * mmm i like all people tho - bc it's a way to add a status like i love to do on discord. and joinable people would allow people to join me if im playing my switch or something
        * questions for myself
          * would it be better to do this without technology?
            * maybe can use boards, sticky notes, and index cards -- AND my technology. Main thing is i want this to work across to the tea house too - not just in there
          * what do if i dont build this before vc?
            * try to use boards, sticky notes, and index cards
          * okay so what should the app look like?
            * maybe about same as parallel - except designed only for mobile-first AND no choose context
            * i need to REALLY take step by step or ill get paralyzed - so i think im just gonna really focus on a feed of desires and help requests people can check during vc. The obvious issue is people not closing these items, but sorting by latest mostly fixes this...
            * ...would love some WebXR aspect...

      * [[2024-05-25]]
        * vibecamp idea since no one on discord is resonating with my 1st idea
          * ill be meeting people and stuff at vibecamp. can ask people: is there anything you really want to talk about?? i can write it down myself. then i can literally connect people myself
          * i can use the app that i make in order to do this - even if just i use it
      * [[2024-05-27]]
        * building off last idea: can ask people "during this vibecamp event, is there anything you really want to talk about or do or need help with or any other desires?" - then i can have some sort of physical board where i post these. OR can have app i create to post them - and have sticky notes all around with URL for people to check them out. OR both.
        * when there is connection of person with desire and person that can help, the connection is still hard, especailly if trying to be anon - best i can think is to note to people through ui that to make connection probably need to dox
        * DECISION: all desires will be anon. THEY post them or i can post for them if willing to tell me. if they wanna somehow connect, they can 1) put what they look like in post content 2) put info to contact them 3) come to me and i can try to help connect
        * they can also come to me to check if any connections formed (if they dont wanna just check site themself or dont know how to)
        * not needed: but would be cool to connect these posts on my site to posting on my X account in a thread
        * what benefit does this have over just being a thread on my X account?
          * people can be 100% anon
          * it's quick to just post something since no AUTH needed - just need URL to page or to just tell me desire
          * i can add custom reaction that make more sense than just a X heart
        * [[2024-05-30]]
          * what's this idea even about
            * 1) **CONNECTION**: increasing likelihood of connection on niche things in our minds
            * 2) **HELPING PEOPLE**: this is basically same as connection, but this is in hopes that more people get help if they want it
            * 3) **CURIOSITY**: seeing what people need help with and want - with option to be anon so there is no fear around sharing these parts of your mind since not tied to your identity
            * 4) **ME**: this is an experiment that helps me understand some long-term personal projects better >=)
          * how will ppl find out about app?
            * i'll put index cards with app name all over the place
            * word of mouth from me bb
          * extras
            * AUTH with X and ability to create status message like on discord
          * brainstorming
            * okay maybe anons will get name like "anon-uuid" (stored in localstorage) and then there will be auth with X. AUTH mainly 1) puts some sort of unique verified name to your posts 2) gives option for people to DM you on other platform
            * after auth above implemented: each post will have button called reactions and button called react
              * REACT BUTTON: opens modal that says "choose 1 or more" and gives these options to choose: 1) i want this too 2) i want to connect 3) i can try to help 4) i want to connect, but im nervous 5) <input your own text>
              * REACTIONS BUTTON: modal showing list of reactions. Maybe show a count of all diff reactions and then the feed. history of reactions. reaction counts. both dropdowns
            * isDone field on frontend
            * need to make user page
            * websockets?
            * notifications
  * when and how long is vibecamp?
    * June 13th-16th 2024
  * Personal goals for VibeCamp
    * from 2023
      * someone needs to teach me how to bring the funny version of myself out - bc i get access to that funny guy on RARE occasion, but i have no idea how
      * i want to learn how to be more integrated with the terrified version of self - it really hinders me
      * I want to learn how to be alone and go to public event where everyone is with their group and then have ability to meet a bunch of new people. I dont even know how to start convos and anytime i try it ends very awkwardly
      * i want to live as maskless as possible
      * Find people that agree it's okay for me to be as annoying as possible. But obv let me know if i go too far. I always limit myself bc im scared of annoying or hurting people. I want to break free
      * Experiment at least once with focusing on fun that is not complex conversation
      * Find someone that will help with this: i want to try and break free from my face lol. I always feel like i have to laugh when someone else laughs etc. If i dont, it feels v bad. And if i fake it, it feel unauthentic.
        * Breaking free of my face. I know that sounds weird, but I'll explain. In social interactions daily, I will feel emotions inside, but they don't manifest on my face. I observe this and often I observe how being blank face after someone just told a joke, doesn't make them feel good. I want to be able to be completely authentic without making people feel bad whenever they tell a joke and I don't laugh or even smile. Hopefully that makes sense.
      * i want to learn to understand better someone else's POV so that i can be more of a giver (like Marty does every moment)
      * I want to learn to have more extroverted agency like Marty
