  * tracking thoughts on what is meaning
    * [[2024-04-21]]
      * wait, so is meaning stored in a repo nonlocally in time and space? yet somehow we can still access it? through maybe DNA or something else as a conduit from non-POV. But from a POV, maybe you can only access meaning by being with it (i imagine YOU/soul).
      * dont know if this relates, but i feel called to add it: recently ive found can tap into YOU/soul/source by not trying to change anything - simply FEEL everything (even complex thoughts or environments) and resonate with the connected blob of authentic soul/you. If you feel you are trying to force this, thaz not it. You will feel a flow between feeling everything and soul and it requires no change
  * what is meaning?
    * subjective models derived through iterative sensory data points which instance objectively nonlocal and nontemporal Mind
      * from: TesseractDelta - this resonated with me
      * me: i guess quantity of "AHA" of meaning is based on your upbringing and memories? so also based on the intensity of those AHA moments
