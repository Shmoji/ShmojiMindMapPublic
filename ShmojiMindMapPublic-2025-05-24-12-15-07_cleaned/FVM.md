  * Questions
    * Last time i checked, Filecoin is not blockchain, so how can it have smart contracts?
      * Apparently Filecoin is a blockchain now with FVM
  * What does it do?
    * Adds programmability to Filecoin. FVM delivers on-chain programmabilty to the Filecoin network. So basically, you can haz smart contracts
    * FVM allows computation over Filecoin's state
