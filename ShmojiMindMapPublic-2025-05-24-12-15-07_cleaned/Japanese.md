  * some of my LLM prompts for learning Japanese:
    * option 1
      * here's all Japanese words i know. I only know them in kana, not in Kanji:
      * わたし (i)
      * ぼく (i)
      * 私たち (we)
      * くるま (car)
      * あなた (you)
      * ともだち (friend)
      * いく (to go)
      * ある (to exist)
      * する (to do)
      * いる (to be (animate))
      * なる (to become)
      * くる (to come)
      * もう (already)
      * こと (thing)
      * かんがえる (to think)
      * とき (time)
      * みる (to see)
      * だけ (only)
      * あいだ (between)
      * まだ (yet, still)
      * おおい (many)
      * そう (seems, looks like)
      * あかるい (bright)
      * きく (to hear)
      * おもい (heavy)
      * たいへん (difficult)
      * おきる (to wake up)
      * かう (to buy)
      * かえる (to return)
      * とおい (far)
      * あたらしい (new)
      * しずか (quiet)
      * I only know those forms of the words and no other forms.
      * I know the grammar for: は, が, を, に, and で. I know the grammar for asking questions using か. I kind of understand the よ particle.
      * Know that i am trying to learn Japanese using your responses. It's up to you if you decide to do anything with that knowledge.
      * Everytime you receive a prompt from me, can you return 1 Japanese sentence that a 5 year old could understand using only these words? So basically we'll conversate in Japanese, but you only respond one Japanese sentence at a time in every way explained.
      * For each Japanese sentence, can you also translate it to kana.
      * Feel free to add as much English as you need to explain things. That doesn't count towards the one Japanese sentence.
      * If i make any mistakes in my Japanese, feel free to simply correct me - but dont go too overboard focusing on that.
  * questions
