    * Synchron Switch
      * stent-like device. Less invasive than #neuralink - Synchron uses a minimally-invasive endovascular procedure (similar to the placement of stents) that avoids open brain surgery
    * Stentrode
      * The companyâ€™s stent, called the Stentrode, is fitted with tiny sensors and, after insertion, is delivered to the large vein that sits next to the motor cortex. So it senses motor signal.

      * RAW BRAINNN: collects the raw brain data and send it out of body wirelessly to then connect with external devices. Always on and ready to go.
