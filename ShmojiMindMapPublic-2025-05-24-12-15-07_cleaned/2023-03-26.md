    * I feel im bad at intros and outros

    * Intuitive social was tonight. My method to talk to new people is just walk over and stare at them. Which is weird, especially when they're in convo. I did it and joined by warmly joining the convo at hand. but before i just stood there awkwardly. 
    * I get all tense when trying to leave people been talking to. Today i did it and felt v awkward. I think because i dont wanna hurt anyone by leaving. 
    * But aside from being bad at those, i felt like the extrovert today yet again. I surprisingly get lots of attention. And i achieved my goal of meeting many people instead of sticking with one squad
