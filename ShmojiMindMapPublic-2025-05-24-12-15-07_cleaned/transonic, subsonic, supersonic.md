  * what is it?
    * **Subsonic**: Speeds less than the speed of sound.
    * **Supersonic**: Speeds greater than the speed of sound.
    * **Transonic**: Speeds close to the speed of sound, typically from about Mach 0.8 to Mach 1.2.
    * During transonic speeds, some parts of the airflow around the object may be supersonic while other parts are subsonic, creating unique aerodynamic challenges and changes in the flow characteristics.
