  * NOTE: this is journal for accomplishing my desires - but also for understanding what my desires are, why they are - and understanding desires in general
  * tracking
    * mid 2023
      * Note i took and built on during existential crisis caused by not liking my job: start abstract and then break down to specifics without anxiety gettin ya -  (examples?)
        * what do i want to do more specifically in bullets?
          * 1) i want to create either a large story or an entire universe
            * what is the UX of creating it from my POV?
              * i can casually create new good content for it on a daily basis without much effort
                * since universe is in my mind too, i imagine somehow that's related to this aspect

            * what are the details of that?
              * i want the creation to be interwoven with my identity, my mind, and my online precense
              * i want there to be mystery
            * questions for myself
              * do i want to create a system that generates a story or do i want to create the stories themselves?
                * probably both, but more focused on actual stories rn i think
              * what is driving me to create this (WHY?)
                * INSPIRATION: ive seen many other creations (movies, shows, homestuck, etc) and everytime it makes me want to execute on this
                  * what specifically inspires me?
                * i want to create something that people can get LOST in. This is how content i consume makes me feel and i love it
                * i want to create something that builds on itself so people can have something good to look forward to consuming when the next thing comes out
          * 2) i want a community
          * 3) i want adventure weekly
          * 4) i want closeness/romance/love
          * 5) i want to give away money, but with a catch
            * what are some ex challenges?
              * it starts with:
                * 1) a cryptic tweet

            * how will i give money away?
              * it will be stored in some decentralized way so that it's claimable without anything from me
            * why do dis?
              * i think it could be an incentive for me to learn tools AND to give money to people if they're gud enough
              * the challenges should be fun - like the halo 3 jump map back in the day
    * [[2023-12-20]]
      * ive noticed there's 2 types of desires in my current POV. There's resolvable desires and non-resolvable desires. Kind of same with goals or TODOs

  * tracking how to format desires to better accomplish them
    * [[2023-12-20]]
      * im currently changing the format of my TODO list (goals) and the format of my list of desires.

i think i have found a format for my goals that truly works for bringing quick action

however, i cannot find the right format for my list of desires. i think it's because my goals are governed by my desires...but my desires are governed by the unknown...so im uncertain what the best way is to organize them

currently organizing my desires by predicted complexity, but that doesnt feel right

gonna brainstorm different ways to format my desires:

- by priority/importance
- by aesthetic
- by complexity
- by mood

i think i may format based on a mix of these - just gotta figure out how that actualizes
      * the order may matter for the format. im stuck on whether should sort by importance first or complexity first
      * well when do i reference my list of desires? or when should i? i feel like i rarely do bc i always reference my TODO list. maybe i can start referencing my desires once a month bc seems good to reference occasionally just to keep on track - i basically did this during my existential crisis due to job (when considering going back to school and whatnot due to AGI)
      * due to above point, i think priority/importance is more important to sort by first compared to complexity - since desires are very high level and long timespan
    * [[2023-12-21]]
      * ive noticed desires seem to be things that may never actually happen. Once there is significant chance they can happen, they move to TODO list
