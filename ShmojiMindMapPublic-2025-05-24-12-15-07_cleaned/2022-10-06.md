  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Thought i could go without Claritin D but was feeling 8/10 bad and had to at 1am morning before deep cleaning 
    * Had deep gum cleaning, antibiotics on molers, fluoride, and 4 cavities filled (2 molers on top left and 2 molers on lower right)
    * Dentist recommended water pick because it can get deeper in gums than floss
  * [[TODO soon]]
    * [x] Buy water pick
