  * what is shmoji in whyspia?
    * 1) just where i post my most resonant art. art im proud of
    * 2) the process of building inward whyspia - a home of people that just wanna build beautiful things and learn
    * 3) the process of figuring out and acting on the outward whyspia - a haven for alignment and vibes
    * NOTE: these may be parts of [[heart of whyspia]] too, but this place is specifically me. my journey. Like i wanna do 2 and 3 with others, but ill still have my separate journey apart from the others (unless we connect with BCI and become one entity lmao - but that is not a vibe for me...anytime soon)
  * tracking stuff
    * tracking the path
      * [[2025-02-17]]
        * REALIZATION: i think id be willing to get a job if it allowed me to create whyspia: the haven for alignment on the side. Imagining living in Japan on 2nd floor of house. first floor is where business is that people come for alignment/home/vibes.
        * almost feel like i can see myself working on the ideamarket mission again parttime while building whyspia
        * when i say building whyspia, i mean 2 things: 1) internally: a home of people that just wanna build beautiful things
2) outwardly facing service: a haven for finding alignment + building tools that make alignment possible anywhere
        * even better if i can find people that are willing to COMMIT with BOTH
        * i think the worry is that i end up in house in Japan alone being wageslave again and making no progress in making whyspia fulltime
        * but like...how could i even make a haven for alignment and vibes make me money... ^hoAo1XFLc
          * only idea is become therapist...but that even requires years of school...and that's not even what i wanna do TODO: what i wanna do outwardly for others?
          * i guess i could look more into life coach path. i wonder if there any Japanese ones that could mentor me
          * i still like idea of techno temple and finding way to survive like a temple somehow
          * build tech for my home/community - especially social tech
          * help people THAT EXPLICITLY want to get aligned...get more aligned in life. so asking my main question and for those that feel lack - finding ways to help them. how would i help?
            * i can listen
            * i can ask questions that hopefully direct them towards alignment and their heart
            * i can try to connect them with those that could help better than me
            * im good af at organization. i could help them organize what they say to point them towards alignment/heart. ex: desires, feelings
            * i can use tech ive built to further make the above possible
      * [[2025-02-18]]
        * throwback to temples, Student Union at App, CS computer lab at App, Coltrane 4th lobby, Espresso News sitting on 2nd floor coding with tons of people around (1st floor too lol)
        * maybe i can buy property in Japan and turn it into something like that. People can just show up and create. Ill usually be there. Maybe i live there at first, but then get my own private place once that place is more poppin
        * tbh, if i just bought a regular house - i could lock one room (like my coltrane room) and then leave everything else open 24/7
        * thing that helps errytime i worry about money: i can literally just instantly get freelance coding work at anytime. im OP in that sense...so just do what youd do with infinite money/time

      * [[2025-03-02]]
        * still trying to make this shiz tangible
        * a place for 24/7 low-effort hangout
          * donations accepted for this place
          * this is the: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/heart of whyspia#^a7ZWkaRnu|"do your own thing, with other people close (or just go chat, we're not your mom)"]]
          * home to all; all are welcome
        * a community interested in:
          * building ALL tech completely OS for the community. Our own version of AWS. Our own hardware. Our own Twitter and instagram. Similar vibe to living off the land.
          * helping people that feel a lack when asked: do you feel aligned and connected enough with the people, places, and rhythms of your life?
          * MAYBE: building a digital commons
          * this is a more curated community that is tight-nit and brought together due to being aligned
          * they want to be in aligned community
          * they want community in general
        * im uncertain if the Third Place and the community can exist in same location or not. I feel like i want the community to be building for all futures - even dystopian; so im not sure home base should be a public space welcome to all. Maybe okay in beginning but idk. I think id be down, but all community members would have to be okay with our sharehouse commons being public while we each getting our own room.
        * i need to MEME what im trying to build: ^816IsxAr2
          * im trying to build 1) a Third Place and 2) a community aligned in specific ways
          * third place:
            * a place for 24/7 low-effort hangout...you dont need money and dont need traditional socializing
            * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/heart of whyspia#^a7ZWkaRnu|"do your own thing, with other people close (or just go chat, we're not your mom)" ^a7ZWkaRnu]]
            * home to all; all are welcome
          * community
            * HELPING WITH LACK OF ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTION: do you feel aligned and connected enough with the people, places, and rhythms of your specific daily life?
            * TECHNOLOGICALLY SELF-SUFFICIENT: entire tech stack - from hardware to software (interested in same vibe with food/resources too). we want to survive. we want to protect.
            * MAYBE: building a digital commons
            * they want community in general. think this is subtle bc there's tons of ppl out there that literally want community explicitly, yet still cant find it
          * tldr: i wanna help people that are struggling with alignment and connection (including myself)
        * this resonates:
          * i just want to do what i want when i want. and i want the same for everyone
          * but if i cant do what i want, then i want sufficient alignment with the people, places, and rhythms of my life. And same for everyone
          * But if alignment isnt even possible, i just want safety and to be as cozy as possible in an uncozy environment. And want same for everyone in this situation

    * tracking thoughts while searching for house and what even matters to narrow search
      * [[2025-02-17]]
        * WALKABLE: really important: walkable community ^yHjZwXULS
          * can walk to restaurants
          * can walk to all needed stores
          * can walk to neighbors
          * can walk to trains and busses
          * not needed, but even better: there's some social central hubs people can just go to and hang - can walk to them
        * RENOVATION: not much renovation needed - will do up to few thousand USD ^AdOoxxzUI
        * SAFETY: high safety in terms of natural disasters ^nvNgSPvsb
          * safe from earthquakes
          * safe from tsunamis
          * safe from typhoons
          * safe from mudslides and flooding
          * safe from volcanos
        * HUB: really important i would like to be near hub (like Tokyo) - this is because not everyone i love/aligned with can move to Japan. Being in hub allows constant opportunities to meet new people - less ops if in middle of nowhere. NOTE: i am confident i want to meet as many as people as possible in my life and make as many frens as possible ^JJQ0NzOuC
          * but i suppose i could buy something that appears to be becoming a hub or that i can make into a hub (but less chance of that working out)
        * YARD/OUTSIDE: would like to have at least a small yard or balcony for hanging out at outside without needing to leave home ^iW8qC8h9X
        * AESTHETICS: i think the thing that matters least, but is somewhat important: the vibes i get when just looking at it (kinda related to aesthetics) ^ois6klA2i
          * i imagine how lil closet at Coltrane is still one of best places i ever lived due to community
        * HAS PARKING ^viRZKVC6P

      * [[2025-02-18]]
        * today i did a ton of searching online
        * bought akiya-mart sub in hopes it would help me have higher chance of finding property that aligns with what i want
        * what i learnt:
          * Google streetview helps a lot lol
          * i wanted to be in or right beside a hub or lively area - it helped to first find these on map and then search that area on Akiya Hub map for finding for sale props
          * typically good to find the station and look for akiya there bc that's usually the hub
          * maybe i can search for PLAZAS bc those vibe with me and go from there
          * can also chatgpt town centers and go from there
        * THOUGHTS ON KOMORO CITY AFTER ONLINE SEARCH: i really dont think Komoro vibes for me since im looking for the vibe of a hub (may be wrong and will change mind once there). I will still look in Komoro City and Nagano City for hub-like spot tho
        * places i searched on AkiyaMart
          * Ueda
            * (about 18 km away from Komoro - closest major city): a commercial and cultural center in nagano prefecture
          * Takasaki
            * (about 51 km away from Komoro - 3rd closest major city): a major city in gunma prefecture, known as a transportation hub.
          * Nagano
            * (about 41 km away from Komoro)
          * DONE: Komoro City
            * done bc dont think i have interest due to not being walkable/hub
          * Tokyo
            * everything was pretty much too expensive sadge, but ill check again later
        * think next time i need to go through my saved and eliminate any i can and rank them. If time after that, ill search out again for more. But i dont wanna travel to toooo many diff cities during my travels, so try to not choose places too far (maybe i can resolve on which places soon?)
      * [[2025-02-19]]
        * how to search
          * first search and take notes on the city: is it safe, is temps good...thaz about it...will find out if it is hub during more narrow search

        * [x] cities to search in again (after deciding if i can make to all these cities in 1 trip):
          * DONE - MAYBE: Ueda
            * only one affordable house. Will see if i can check it out on my trip
          * DONE - MAYBE: Nagano City
            * found 2 that are kindaa expensive...but maybe good
            * seems safe from natural disasters
          * DONE - BAD: Takasaki
            * honestly quite pretty, but a bit too spread apart for me i think. not hub enough
          * DONE - BAD: Komoro City
            * naa. no options and not hub.
          * DONE - BAD: Safe Tokyo Cities and maybe ones that are hubs/plazas (use list in perplexity chat)
            * DONE: hubs
              * DONE: Shibuya
                * too expensive sadge
              * DONE: Shinjuku
                * too expensive sadge
              * DONE: Roppongi
                * too expensive sadge
              * DONE: Harajuku
                * too expensive sadge
              * DONE: Ikebukuro
                * too expensive sadge
            * DONE: safe cities
              * DONE: Tokorozawa
                * no affordable options
              * DONE: Hachioji

                * no affordable options
              * DONE: Fuchu
                * no affordable options
              * DONE: Koganei
                * saw one but feel meh about it. will review it more later
              * DONE: Nishitokyo
                * im too poor
              * DONE: Hino
                * maybe one i like but still expensive
          * DONE - BAD: Kyoto
            * nothing resonated
    * tracking where to put lore and stories in whyspia or maybe even artifacts or collectibles
      * [[2024-07-25]]
        * was pondering on where to put my stories instead of just on a blog or on my site - had idea of finding books in Skyrim in random places.
        * i could make my stories collectibles that are found OR you earn by completing some physics challenge

  * [[maybe resonant properties ive found in Japan, Akiya, home, house]]
  * question
    * how can i ACTUALLY add value EXTERNALLY through whyspia?
      * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/shmoji in whyspia#^hoAo1XFLc|but like...how could i even make a haven for alignment and vibes make me money...]]
