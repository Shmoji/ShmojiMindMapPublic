  * different types of brain waves
    * specific types
      * Gamma (30-100hz)
        * brain emits this when solving coding problem or playing chess
        * this is what you are most interested in measuring bc they are what are useful for actually controlling things using bci
      * [[beta brain waves (12-30hz)]]
      * [[alpha brain waves (8-12hz)]]
      * [[theta brain waves (4-8hz)]]
      * Delta (0.5-4hz low frequency)
        * brain emits this during deep sleep
    * other categories
      * slow-wave activity
        * Body Keeps the Score: if people have too much slow-wave activity while awake, their thinking is foggy and they exhibit poor judgement and poor impulse control. 80% of children with ADHD and many people with PTSD have excessive slow waves in their frontal lobes
  * noteworthy stuff
    * [[dreaming]] speeds up brain waves
  * history
    * Body Keeps the Score: in late 1950s Uni of Chicago professor Joe Kamiya discovered that people could learn through feedback to tell when they were producing alpha waves (took some subjects only 4 days to reach 100% accuracy). They could also enter voluntarily into an alpha state in response to a simple sound cue
  * how TOs
    * how to measure and understand brain waves?
      * measured with amplitude (varying heights) and frequency (number of times a waveform rises and falls in one second - measured in Hertz Hz or cycles per second cps)
  * questions
    * how are these mesaured
      * using [[EEG, electroencephalogram]]
