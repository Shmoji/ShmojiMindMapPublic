        * today i tried creating a basic 3d character in a basic env with floor. Got stuck on collision really. Gave up
        * noticed some people basically start with code of working threejs app and then go from there...i think i wanna try this
        * may be good way to brainstorm or get a better/quicker version of what i want in my project. imagining my NFT for reading stories and its design
    * tracking what it is

        * my understanding is i have no clue what the actual tech is bc i havent looked at code, BUT it is using LLM to simulate a web browser - you're not seeing actual web pages
    * tracking usecases

        * tbh this may be good for brainstorming creative projects and getting inspirations
  * questions
    * what have i accomplished in websim before?
      * imported GLTF rock platform
      * got lil collideable boxes you can jump off of
      * got 1st person player that can move with WASD and mouse
      * can use a variable to change gravity and jumpHeight

    * how to use assets or other files in code in websim?
      * one way: use "add asset" button to add it. Then go to https://websim.ai/p/rx8ny800ncy6rni7ma9i and enter your projectid found in console of your project and latest version number - then there you can see URLs for your uploaded assets - use those.
