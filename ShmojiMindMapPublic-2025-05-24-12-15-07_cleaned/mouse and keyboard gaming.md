    * how to posture (need to redo this)
      * upper body
        * table needs to be right at the height that allows your elbow to be bent at 90 degrees - to get this will probably need chair pulled CLOSE
        * elbows off desk beside your body
        * ehh idk: will feel pressure of arm resting on desk where the emos cut
      * lower body
        * feet on ground and legs 90 degrees
      * do NOTs
        * ehh idk: do not have pressure on palms - i always suck when i find myself doing this - although maybe sometimes good for really precise aiming
    * how to figure out sensitivity ^2QVepqyLM
      * reasonable sensitivity: minimum 20cm/360 (it takes 20cm horizontal mouse-slide in 1-direction to make ur character in game do 360). Average range is 20-40cm.
      * Plug in DPI and game sensitivity to find value above without needing to physically measure (although, some say you can trust DPI told by mouse companies): https://gamingsmart.com/mouse-sensitivity-converter/valorant/
      * to optimize sensitivity, it's important to have a lot of desk space for mouse movement
