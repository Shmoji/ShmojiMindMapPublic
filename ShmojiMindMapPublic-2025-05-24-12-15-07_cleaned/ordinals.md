  * what are they?
  * anecdotes:
    * AdrianDittmann: apparently you dont send ordinals to a BTC address or they are lost - you send them to BCP address. But i think i misheard that and can find no info on what he was talking about
  * questions
    * What can Bitcoin Ordinals do that Ethereum NFTs can't?
      * @TO: Onchain, embedded & interactive javascript applications inside artwork tens of MBs large
        * some other person: can just use ETH
          * @TO: Sure, *in the limit* Ethereum can do anything Bitcoin can do and vice versa. But you wouldn't use a hand screw to assemble furniture that needs a power drill. You wouldn't use Ordinals to issue a token with complex issuance, transfer, or escrow logic and you wouldn't launch a 20MB interactive and onchain javascript application embedded into an Ethereum NFT.
          * @TO: it can, just like you can build websites in C++

completely impractical and incredibly complex to do it
