      * pain is about 1/10 today. Much better than past 2 days. So maybe my guesses about the cause from a few days ago were right...damn you Moes (maybe)

      * Felt so low pain yesterday that i could workout. Ran about 1.5 miles. Woke up today still feeling good so far. Wonder if the supplement is helping rebuild my cell membranes and is to thank for better symptoms

    * my mood is highly affected by music. i'll be feeling shit and then play Masayoshi Takanaka and feel my mood get so much better quickly. I can tell today bc i was feeling meh, couldnt take action on anything, and was doing a lot of dopamine-searching actions like checking social media every 2 seconds - then, i put on music and i gained ability to focus and take action and generally felt good.
