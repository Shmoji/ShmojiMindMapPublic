      * Well i definitely deal with oxidative stress for sure based on labs and inflammation - so maybe i should start supplementing
      * ive always taken mag Chloride and it helps tremendously. So scared to stop it since it works. But i know many people i know take Mag Glycinate. Maybe i can try to take both

  * what glycine does:
    * based on Tally Health email:
      * Increases the production of creatine, which supplies muscles with energy, and glutathione, an important antioxidant that repairs cells.
      * Is the most abundant amino acid in collagen, an essential protein for healthy muscles, tendons, and bones.
      * Reduces systemic inflammation and improves glucose tolerance.
      * Decreases levels of methionine, a pro-aging amino acid, and activates the cellular recycling process autophagy.
      * Supports heart health and predicts heart attack risk.
      * Stimulates the production of serotonin, the “feel good” hormone that boosts mood and sleep in mice.
      * Improves subjective sleep quality in individuals with insomniac tendencies.
      * May reduce the harmful effects of alcohol on the liver and improve symptoms of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  * questions
    * what about glycine could be responsible for extending lifespan?
      * Tally Health email:
        * answer may lie in glutathione, a potent antioxidant for which glycine is crucial. Our body’s ability to produce glutathione decreases with age, which can lead to oxidative stress, accelerated aging, and an increased risk of age-related diseases [12]. Research shows that through glycine supplementation (and dietary cysteine, an amino acid found in eggs, meat, and whole grains), glutathione synthesis can be restored and reduce oxidative stress.
