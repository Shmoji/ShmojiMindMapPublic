  * NOTE: it seems the best way to organize mind map is to optimize based on search - making it quicker and more efficient whatever that means
  * tracking how to organize items of things like movies (no idea how this transfers to other lists)

Ex: just put hashtag descriptors beside each movie name and then can see all filters at top and can toggle each on and off as you please. Nesting them seems to bias them too much in one direction - ex: some movie isnt just sad, it's also 49% funny]]

But tbh it prob wouldnt be thatttt hard for me to recreate that functionality - especially with ai nowadays]]

      * something im wondering, how do i know when a page should be searched using text nested categories on the page or filters? - maybe ill try making a tag for that or something
      * so there's kind of: 1) searching using just a page 2) searching using text nested categories on a page 3) searching using filters on page 4) searching using filters on the linked references (can do unlinked too)
      * i think 1 is most basic (less time, less curated) and 4 is most advanced (more time, more curated). So, the more time you plan to spend with a thing, the more you should use higher search like 4. But maybe you should just do 4 always to plan for everything?? but maybe it's just gonna be based on time idk.

Although maybe can still make movies page useful and also use linked filters if you want - idk yet]]
      * experimenting with tags now and learning. almost seems like each page needs 1) ontology that helps with searching mind map and 2) ontology that helps me understand as quick as possible in my personal language using my recall indices
      * ill call 1 - [[search map]] ; 2 - [[recall map]]
      * hmm maybe it's best for 1 to all be one 1 line - otherwise you make searching limited by having one node on top of others - so you can filter by everything under it, but cant filter the child in terms of the parent
      * i wonder if putting the 2 nested under the 1 is the move? it might be - at least it felt right for [[movies with no or lil mapped info]]
      * shit now im confused again and maybe thinking 1 and 2 cant be separated ugh
      * when thinking from POV of me looking for info some typical questions come up:
        * okay i made it to first symbol, is info i need there? or is the info on another symbol that links to this symbol I'm currently on? if so, did i correctly link to the right symbol?
    * [[2024-01-08]]
      * i think separating search map and recall map is actually bad. you want to combine so nodes are as close as possible with info for understanding. Not sure i know how to explain that yet tho
      * However, i do think symbol map can be quite useful for tags that you know are related but dont know where to put in the recall map - dont wanna add that extra noise in connected environment
  * tracking when to make a page/note and when not to
    * [[2024-02-18]]
      * well what even is that process? documenting answer to this here: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking thoughts on how to organize mind map#^3KoL0ZdJv|what are you doing when you make a page/note?]]
      * if you dont plan on accessing that symbol alone - not really any point in creating it locally. Might as well map it to the most useful parent symbol. And if you do need to map SOME info to it, can just do so inside the parent symbol as nested data points. Can even add tags nested to help with filtering and finding it

  * questions
    * what are you doing when you make a page/note? ^3KoL0ZdJv
      * well in Roam at least, when you then press command to search - these page/notes will be highlighted. Like youll find all text youve taken when typing in searchbar, but only the specific titles will be highlighted (thanks to Roam)
      * so it's basically an explicit agentic mapping of info to a symbol
      * i THINK this may be a process of making that symbol MORE local...but not confident about that yet. i guess when you create a page/note, you are making the index more local to you. So if you dont access it often, then that actually hurts you to make more local to you...maybe? Bc if you didnt create page for it and instead nested it under symbol that you DO access often, then that is v useful
