    * Maybe i can make a feeling of community and allow people to be a part of something and be more interactive by using persistence. They can track how many times they've popped in and said hey or how long theyve spent watching me or something.

    * I've noticed many times when i have a kidney stone flair up, i have stomach issues at same time. For example, having flair up that just started around midday. At same time it started, my tum has been hurting and gurgling. Also, been pooping a lot and it's diarrhea-like, more like ice cream coming out of machine. 
    * Maybe i can eventually find what triggers these stones. Had 1 trigger in past few months when at dad's. Very short lived. Now i have one at my apartment today. I've been eating a lot of chicken, broccoli, brown rice. 
    * Something rare i did recently is took glutathione for 3 days for pee test and stopped this morning. It's meant to bring out mycotoxins so they can be seen in pee. So maybe it triggered stone pain?
