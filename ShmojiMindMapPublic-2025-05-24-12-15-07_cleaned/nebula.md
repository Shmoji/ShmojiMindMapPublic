  * what is it?
    * vast cloud of gas and dust in space
    * not always created from supernova
  * list of nebula
    * the Crab Nebula
      * stats
        * diameter: 11 light years
        * distance from us: 6500 light years
        * star inside is size of small city and rotates 30 times every second
      * history:
        * in 1054, Chinese astronomers spotted supernova in sky with naked eye bc it remained as bright spot in sky for weeks - even during daytime.
        * by 1731, supernova formed nebula - which was discovered by English astronomer John Bevis. 
        * Was first astronomical object found that corresponded to a historical supernova
        * Name comes from William Parsons who observed nebula in 1840 and produced drawing that looked somewhat like a crab
        * Helped confirm existence of [[pulsars]] in the 1960s
      * other notes
        * cant see with naked eye today, but can with binoculars or telescope
        * there is [[neutron star]] in the supernova remnant
    * Gum Nebula
      * One unique feature of the nebula is the arm-shaped structure stretching into space.
      * It’s home to an object known as “God’s Hand” among the faithful. The rest of us call it CG 4. ([[cometary globule]])
