    * tracking thoughts on bci/acc in general (can maybe better categorize later)

        * pondering on this more as i continue digesting. it almost seems paradoxical. because you create a local superintelligence of yourself using bci devices, but then it becomes its own agent that is separate from you

so there's no saying if that agent will end up adversarial or not. no saying if this will actually "align" anything. if it cuts you like a fingernail, i'd say that's not alignment

in that context, feels like the bci meant to be a competitive advantage actually ended up being the downfall

the important thing i feel im converging on is: how do we keep and continue to nurture and grow the fingernail despite the fact that the fingernail is being forced to convert to silicon - else risk being exterminated
        * but assuming ASI is inevitable and if you compare:
1) ASI gets here from small group of people using bci
2) ASI gets here from entire population using bci

i suppose # 2 is better and birthing digital entities from our current biostack will create closeness between biostack:silicon stack pairs

and the more of this "closeness" that forms, the better....maybe??

yeesh this is tough stuff to think about lol

im currently writing something related to this that could have impact and trying to make sure i know what im doing
  * how can bci help towards ai alignment?
    * increasing human capacity
      * further questions
        * can bci actually increase human capacity?
        * will increased human capacity through bci actually help with ai alignment?
