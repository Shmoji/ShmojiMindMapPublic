    * Yesterday i took first hour of work day to instead go get brekky with gparents. I found that livened my entire day. Felt super energetic. Today I started day by getting work done on XP project. This exhausted me a little, but also livened me to work on a passion early in day. So, it seems social > personal project > work in terms of what brings me to life to be more alive and effective throughout the day
