  * tracking my sentiment on using it
    * [[2024-04-28]]
      * so i realized i try to figure out if i should use it, then i ask them a question, and often they dont answer - so then im blocked
      * im thinking i should just consider it a whole other project im going to play with and learn - even if it doesnt end up being useful to me. it's a risk, but i think worth it and i vibe with them so
      * so if i replaced mongoDB or collabed with current emote implementation rn, this would already allow credible exit. Because people could just sync their data on any device without needing me at all. Im uncertain if they need noosphere cli/client to get that data down or not - i feel like they do, but it's all OS so i guess not an issue. Whereas rn, their data is locked in my hosted mongoDB

      * today i tried getting orb - which is the cli working. Mostly worked, but maybe had issues bc i was using 2 spheres on one laptop. Okay cool i learned it's basically your own localfirst git/github
      * But then left wondering what next. Like i dont wanna learn deep details of noosphere. I wanna learn how to use it in Nextjs app that i make. I think next step is to try and get Subconscious working. This would show me how to use Noosphere for an app. If i could figure this out - i could replace emote backend with this. I dont think id even need a backend anymore. Youd define all models on frontend and Noosphere handles data storage stuff. Although, i am curious how subconscious is using sqllite - like when use DB vs store in gateway vs local
  * TODO
    * [ ] get VM running latest mac. Then try to get subconsious working
