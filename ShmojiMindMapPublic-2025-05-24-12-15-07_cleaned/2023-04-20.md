    * Realized today i am literally a crybaby. Today i was getting into my fav part of job and exploring innovative tech in hopes that it could benefit us. Told G and he referred me to jira board to work on more tangible stuff. Being denied a nice groove i found made my emotions unhappy lol. I literally felt like crying for like 30 minutes. It was like a physical feeling persisting to make me feel bad.
