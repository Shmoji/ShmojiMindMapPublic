  * this world (try not to break these dynamics - but if so tell Wendell secretly)
    * mechanics
      * you can have as many skills as you want. But +1 in many skills could be un-useful. Idea is to have many skills built around emotions based on how your character instantly reacts to stuff
      * how to play game:
        * 1) get gud get points. You want to figure out how to use your best emotion to conquer obstacles. But decide what feels most authentic vs desires
        * 2) encountering emotions that arent necessarily yours/authentic. Embodiment. Acceptance. Even the ones that youre the worst at. 
    * Joy, fear, anger, neutral, sadness 
      * Decide which of these dice you want to attach to it

He views this alien as good and bad. It may be killing his body in ways, but the gift it is giving him is very good.
