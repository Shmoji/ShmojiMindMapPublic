    * Today i am doing experiment and im doing my best to have no thoughts that are in english. I guess my intention is to make it so my mind is not clogged with inefficient processes. Seems like the meaty stuff is lower level, but harder for me to observe that stuff bc clogged with english thoughts. I'm genuinely unaware of the value-add of my english thoughts; hopefully i can figure it out through this experiment.

        * i think i prefer this. it doesn't make bad feels much better, but it makes most moments less clogged with info. Lil bit more clarity

    * today i realized i often hyper focus on the interfaces in life unintentionally (text when reading, voice when talking, voice when listening). it seems focusing on the real thing the interfaces point to is a source of meaningful energy.

    * HAVEN: Called about 4 lab tests i need to do for Haven Medical. There are 2 pee tests to pickup from Haven, 1 blood test, and 1 nasal swap. They said $1600 of money i paid for Haven program goes to lab tests, so dont need to pay out of pocket. But until i pay my last installment, only $400 has gone towards labs so far, so i can only afford 1 urine test.
