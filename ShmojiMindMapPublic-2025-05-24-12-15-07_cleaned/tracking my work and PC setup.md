      * Just got nice standing desk. I wish it went a tiny bit lower. I have to put chair to highest so i can get 90 degree arms with table at lowest. Causes my legs to hand and feet cant touch ground.
      * So that chords dont snap from shortness when adjusting table, i have to keep PC on another desk beside. Not ideal
      * Ideally, i'd have a setup that is just a laptop and not a desktop. That way i can easily take all my work everywhere
      * I'd like this laptop to have the ability to do all gaming, all work, and stream too. For streaming, i'd just plugin a cam and mic and maybe a light.
