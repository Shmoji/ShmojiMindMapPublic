  * STORY: you can predict the future through story. Read what [[story]] is. Then, read what the most important relationship story mediates (potentiality and actuality). Whatever story you choose is one that is most likely to come into existence. Doesnt allow us to perceive an objective future existing separately from us, but rather in sense that we are literally creating the future through our stories in each and every moment. To distinguish this phenomena from superstition - call this [[hyperstition]].
