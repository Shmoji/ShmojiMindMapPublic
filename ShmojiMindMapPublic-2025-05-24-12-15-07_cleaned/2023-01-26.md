    * Yesterday entire day was very low pain, which is rare. Woke up at 3am today and jaw muscles hurt on jaw floor, throat, and at jaw at joint on both sides. Teeth genuinely felt numbish like i was clenching. ears hurt a little. Could greatly feel and hear pulse in ears. left bottom foot twitched, not sure how that's related to TMJD lol. Top nose sinus pain. Lots of nasal drip almost choking me.

    * my questions to research
      * does TMJD cause pulse in ears

      * not question, but fit dentek you tard

      * can TMJD cause spasm in foot?
    * Got called by infectious disease to setup appointment today. I got emergency referral and they wanted to schedule quick. But i didnt schedule bc they had me not with Dr Perfect (bc he out of insurance probably). Referral is good for 1 year and i told i will call back after insurance change. Number to call is 984 974 7198
    * To save money in February, i cancelled both dental and medical insurance
