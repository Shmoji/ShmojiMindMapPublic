    * woke up and kidneys felt prettyyy heavy. After getting sun and taking shower, they felt better for some reason. Like 1-2/10 heavy. Will keep tracking.
    * Been pooping more recently. Maybe 2-3 times per day instead of once. Also poops been smelling realll smelly lol.
    * After lunch, kidneys started feeling heavier. Maybe 4/10 heavy and some spasms in kidney area. 
    * I think around 2 i peed and my kidneys felt less heavy after. Is this me peeing out all the mycotoxins that have been plaguing me for years?
    * just realized: have not dealt with constant mucus going down throat since starting this experiment
