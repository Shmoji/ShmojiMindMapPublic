    * WHAT and HOW questions are naturally coupled BC the strength with which a vision inspires a culture is proportional to how beautiful its answer to the what question is. So, the [[wisdom]] is provided to the culture from the outside by the sovereign being that is the vision. Guided by this, the culture can then fully engage in the quests of answering the HOW question by coming up with a strategy. So, no matter how great the power dwelling in the strategy will become it will always be guided by the wisdom that motivated it in the first place
