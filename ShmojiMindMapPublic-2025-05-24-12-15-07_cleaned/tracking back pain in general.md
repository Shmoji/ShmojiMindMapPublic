      * not confident in it yet, but i think whenever my entire spine hurts, that symptom is due to either:
      * 1) too much gluten
      * 2) too much seed oils
      * 3) too much sugar
      * noting this down and will figure it out

  * questions
    * What helps my back pain?
      * Child pose with arms spread in front
        * I just had back pain from low to top. I did this pose and it helped a lot.
