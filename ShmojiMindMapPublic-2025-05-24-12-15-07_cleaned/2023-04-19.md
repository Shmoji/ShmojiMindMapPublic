  * Taxes
    * Why i paid so much for 2022 taxes: paying 8% more across the board due to SS and Medicare taxes from self employment. Everyone pays 16%, but employers have to pay 50% of it for their employees. 
So your effective tax rate isnt 13.8%, its 21.9%. James had about same AGI as me and only paid like $6000, but i have to pay like $15000.
