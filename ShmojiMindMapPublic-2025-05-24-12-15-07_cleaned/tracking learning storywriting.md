  * tracking my own writing observations
    * [[2024-07-18]]
      * trying to write ultimate observer story. pasted into claude. it taught me i was writing in 3rd person omniscient. claude converted it to 3rd person limited and it sounded so much better. keeps you on edge of seat, has mystery. there is less of narrator in story it feels like. it's more intimate with the character(s) of focus.
      * i asked it to do 3rd person omniscient and still defs better than mine, but i noticed i didnt vibe with it as much as limited. it was like 90% descriptions. not intimiate - doesnt throw you into the story like limited pov.
      * i think im pretty good at 1st person, but dont think it works for all types of writing. i think 1st person doesnt hook people as much as 3rd person limited too
      * CONCLUSION: 3rd person omniscient is kinda boring, im pretty good at 1st person but it's maybe a bit boring, i cant do 3rd person limited but it seems like stuff that keeps you at edge of seat

      * it seems i very often use 3rd person omniscient where me the narrator's viewpoint is being used - which contains spoilers and is all-knowing. i accidentally use too much
      * noticed i use 2nd person a good bit too. EX: "gunter spent its days simulating nearly anything you can imagine" - I compared to non-2nd person version, but i like 2nd person - it's more personal/casual and provokes a YOU in consumer instead of some objective thing.
      * i really need to practice 3rd person limited somehow bc it seems to be what resonates as sounded good most of the time. it seems to contain a lot of the mystery and beauty for some reason. 
      * for now, ive started a process that is literally working with GPT for converting to ideal sentences. Will keep that chat.
      * i noticed i really like the process of working sentence by sentence on a story with ai. feels like i could do this more casually with my typical phone distractions and still it would work
      * i got a sense that paid GPT was helping me better than non-paid, but maybe prompting skill issue on my side idk
