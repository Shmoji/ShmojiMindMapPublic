  * learning what fermentation is
    * [[2024-09-22]] what is fermentation first try, typically organic molecules for food, anaerobic/aerobic respir, muscle cell, cytoplasm #memo
      * a way for microorganism/cell/"in vitro fermentation" to "eat" and gain energy without needing oxygen, while producing various substances as a result
      * Q: is fermentation a process done by something or done to something?
        * carried out BY cells (living or non-living) **on** an input/organic-molecule. PS: for microorganisms, fermentation still happening in cytoplasm of each cell of microboi
      * Q: is the input for fermentation always organic molecules?
        * yes - basically always
      * What happens in fermentation:
        * Microorganisms consume sugars or other organic molecules (complex carbon-hydrogen bonded/carbon-carbon bonded molecules)
        * They convert these into simpler substances
        * Energy (ATP) is produced for the microorganism - which goes on to do many different types of work/energy-transfer depending where it happens
          * ATP is more "ready-to-go" energy than something like glucose
        * Byproducts like alcohol, acids, or gases are formed
      * Key points:
        * it occurs without oxygen (anaerobic process)
        * a type of metabolism (process of taking in input/food and converting it to energy and build/repair tissue) used by many microorganisms
        * produces less energy than aerobic respiration (will cover this later), but allows survival without oxygen
        * Q: is fermentation anerobic respiration or no?
          * yes, fermentation is type of anerobic respiration - which is broader term referring to any process of producing energy without oxygen
          * fermentation TYPICALLY only uses organic molecules as the final electron acceptor. Whereas broader anerobic respiration can use inorganic molecules as final electron acceptor (last part of energy process i think). There are exceptions where these lines blur, so "typical" word here is important
        * Q: what is aerobic respiration?
          * process where cells break down glucose (sugar) using oxygen to produce energy
          * Glucose (monosaccharide/simple sugar) + Oxygen â†’ Energy (ATP) + Carbon dioxide + Water
          * complex sugar/polysaccharide of banana is starch (just like wheat woah). Turns to glucose for simple sugar - but glucose then often converted by enzymes to other simple sugars like fructose and sucrose (unripe = more starches, ripe = more simple sugars converted by enzymes from starch). WOAH: This process not only makes the banana taste sweeter but also changes its texture, making it softer. i now associate simple sugars with sweet and soft, neat - but not AS much with complex sugars. EDIT: starch isnt sweet. BUT starch plus the right enzymes to ripen something (like amylases in bananas) makes them sweet bc simple sugars ARE sweet! dis why wheat starch not sweet...unless you do something special
          * Where it happens: Mainly in the mitochondria of cells (whereas fermentation occur in cytoplasm of cell - but note that other forms of anaerobic respir can occur in mitochondria and often does)
          * Key points:
            * It's the most efficient way for cells to get energy from food (fermentation = 2 ATP per glucose, other anaerobic respir = lil bit more, aerobic respir = 30-32 ATP per glucose)
            * It requires oxygen. me: bet this is why all cool things and non-tiny life needed abundant oxygen to happen AND why organic molecules known as being basis of life. guess: somehow oxygen + complex C-H/C-C bonded molecules (organic) cause big energy to flow through aerobic resp
            * It produces more energy than anaerobic processes
            * It's used by most plants and animals, including humans
      * Common examples of fermentation:
        * BEER OR WINE: Yeast fermenting sugar to produce alcohol and CO2 in beer or wine making
        * YOGURT: Bacteria fermenting milk to produce lactic acid in yogurt production
        * banana FODMAPs (fructose, fructans) in my tummy by mystery microorganisms in my gut lol
      * in your body:
        * Muscle cells can ferment glucose to lactic acid during intense exercise when oxygen is limited and the oxygen supply can't keep up with the energy demand. They arent microorganisms, so more than just microbois can do fermentation
