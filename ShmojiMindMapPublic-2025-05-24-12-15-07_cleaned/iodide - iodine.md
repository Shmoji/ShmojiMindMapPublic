  * What is it?
    * Iodine is the element found on the **periodic chart**. However, the molecular form, which consists of two atoms of iodine stuck together, is **not** found in nature. Iodide is the salt, which could for example, be iodine combined with calcium or potassium, and can be found in seaweed sources and mineral deposits.
  * Why is it important?
    * Iodine is needed to make the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which assist with the creation of proteins and enzyme activity, as well as regulating normal metabolism. Without enough iodine, these thyroid hormones do not work properly and can lead to an under-active or overactive thyroid gland, causing the medical conditions of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism with various negative side effects in the body.
    * Every single cell in body needs iodine. The thyroid sucks up a lot of it
    * It detoxifies mercury, lead, fluoride, and bromide
    * Can shrink stones in Parotid gland that makes saliva. Although, i have no idea how these stones form
  * Iodine deficiency symptoms
    * Hair loss. If you correct deficiency, hair should come back
    * Fatigue and weakness. 
    * Dry flaky skin. 
    * Feeling colder than usual.
    * Heartrate. A severe iodine deficiency may cause an abnormally slow heart rate. This could make you feel weak, fatigued, dizzy and possibly cause you to faint. Too much iodine can cause heart to go fast. 
  * How to test if you're deficient?
    * If thryoid issues, then that is good sign, but all cells need it, so cant just rely on thyroid. Another method to check: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMaqumn5Lcc

    * Apparently a DR online says iodide as salt is not great way of getting it into body. Apparently milk and bread are better ways.
  * High iodine food
    * Sea kelp
