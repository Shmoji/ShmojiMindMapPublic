  * idk shit about this stuff, let's try to put together some pieces

  * Hamas
    * who are they?
      * Palestinian Islamist militant group which rules the Gaza Strip.
      * Hamas is sworn to Israel's destruction and has fought several wars with Israel since it took power in Gaza in 2007.
        * TODO: put source here where they swear destruction of Israel. I think it's literally in their political documents.
    * what do they want?
      * according to X person: they want to kill all jews
        * my prediction: this is probably mostly true. Most of them probably would feel joy from jews being killed. However, we all shit and piss and fart everyday. I bet you every single one of their minds can change for the better. Not saying it's easy tho.
        * Spinning off above point, right now in October 2023 Hamas are being terrorists and killing people. Right this moment. Stopping them is crucial. Killing them and getting revenge and generating more hatred is the opposite of crucial and useful. The less violence it takes to stop them, the better (bc violence breeds more hatred which breeds more violence in future).
      * questions
        * are all people in Hamas people that want to kill jews?
        * if you killed all people in Hamas, would that breed hatred in their family members that are not terrorists or in some other people? If so, that breeds more violence into the future.
