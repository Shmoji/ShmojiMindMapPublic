  * tracking craving
    * [[2024-05-11]]
      * right now really craving a smoothie. for some reason feel i need it NOW. but also frens gaming right now and i dont wanna miss that. going to get smoothie may mean i miss out on gaming with frens. But im craving so im gonna go get smoothie and hope they are still playing when im back
      * i had [[teriyaki fried rice neo japan]] yesterday and i wonder if it contributes to craving
      * the craving feels like sensations from throat to chest to tummy - tingly sensations. Also thoughts of needing it bc it would be GOOD. And going without it would actually cause physical pain and suffering.

      * notice when i get this it's always for a specific thing
      * i even found excuses towards less-destructive/distracting options, yet i still want the specific thing instead
      * i noticed for food it's never ending until it gets to point where it hurts me enough to make me stop - or something distracts me enough
      * the impulse feeling likes to linger and distract in every moment until fulfilled

      * last few days went on spree of eating soooo much bad stuff. i want to get back to being healthy bc even a teeny tiny bit of bad stuff hurts me so much due to my sensitive body
      * no more sweets unless healthy
      * no more unhealthy snacks like chips or whatever
      * chocolate only every 3 days (started yesterday) - but only healthy chocolate
      * i think i will feel better and appreciate sticking to this
      * can utilize healthy options when craving bad options. if no healthy options, i can distract with something else (maybe find something easy like video game or maybe even just a nap or meditation)
      * would just like to note to future self: this pain rn is not worth it. Maybe like once every 3 months or something, but almost never tbh

      * i had flan - pretty decent piece - and after finished it triggered me realllyyyy wanting more. But felt conflicted bc i clearly had enough. Managed to not get more (easier when knowing other people will be left with more to enjoy)
      * But then the chocos Sarah gave me were just sitting there. Which are muchhh more unhealthy than flan. Yet i couldnt resist and ate almost all of them - which was too much - especially for a big unhealthy sweet
      * i think getting in touch with that hesitation is good for knowing to just not take excess
      * will do better
