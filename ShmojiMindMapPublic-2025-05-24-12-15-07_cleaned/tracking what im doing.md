  * tracking what im doing as time passes so it's more obvious to myself
    * [[2024-06-19]]
      * call with index.network to see if i can build ontop of their tech for api for people
      * today i wanted to truly start on api for people. It's a stuck point trying to get index.network as starting point instead of centralized stuff i already know works
      * i need to get this cyst removed, but im terrified and have been putting tons of time into thinking about that. i texted a dermatology clinic to see if they remove cysts. Waiting for response and pausing this for now. If they do, i guess ill call and schedule appointment. Also need to ask if oxy during surgery is okay
      * made video of Ergo keyboard for fb guy that prob wont even respond lol. Some guy offered $200, but im gonna put on subreddit Shandon mentioned first
      * back to cyst, i called old dermatologist and asked if possible to get referral to plastic surgeon in new town - they will call in next 2 days
      * i would like to do sample app with index network for api for people, but not doing that today. I want to just get started with api for people already - even if centralized
    * [[2024-06-20]]
      * looked at mechmarket and dreaded how much time ill have to put in to post my kb on there
      * made reflection post on vc webapp and then took site down
      * gonna spend time with nana - will see if i end up reading Consider Phlebas, checking emails, coding, or figuring out how to do mechmarket post
      * nana was at doc appointment so hour drive was waste nice. Now im brainstorming details for starting api for people
      * brainstorming api for people
        * how to involve main emote idea and should i?
          * jams sent im going fishing to api4ppl context
          * shmoji sent "followed: im going fishing FROM jams" to api4ppl context
        * whats the main important functionality?
          * getting notifications from symbols you follow
            * i imagine person sends event, system creates notif record for each person following - and that could be a lot - is that an issue?
          * being able to follow
          * being able to send out events
        * should privacy or limited event access be a thing or no? is that related to broader emote idea?
          * to make things easy, gonna just make like a public api where everyone can see everything - and make that clear on site
        * random brainstorming
          * x sent im going fishing to 5 symbols
            * if they sent to 5 symbols, it should only be available to those 5 symbols and no one else has access - but how?
      * think im ready for mechmarket, just gotta take pics with timestamp and username, then create post. although, FB guy said when can we meet, so maybe a done deal? hasn't responded since tho
      * spent time with Nana and haven't done much since except taking out trash and cleaning clothes
      * did vc3 exit survey and read astro newsletter
    * [[2024-06-21]]
      * put clean clothes up
      * bought ipad pro and apple pen bb
      * made big post on what Emote is in broad sense and narrow usecases and talked about how connecting the 2 causes and currently causing to be stuck. So will just focus on narrow usecases for now and not try to connect to broad idea
      * visited nana and Papa with Tyler
      * brainstormed data model for pingppl - after brainstorming name lol
    * [[2024-06-22]]
      * went on run, got shower
      * about to do data models code for pingppl
      * stopped above for a bit to ponder on: stay here for Tyler's bday, drive for fireflies at Grandfather Mountain or what.
        * i like idea of weed and vidyas - especially new coop vidya
        * i dont like idea of long drive, esp since just did so much for VC and have to go to ortho week after fireflies anyways
        * but do like idea of connecting with M to catchup, talk about vc, enjoy fireflies in nature
      * struggling to make progress on pingppl bc coding sucks
      * gonna try going to see nana and see if i can code there. I think if i wanna code, i shouldn't go there, lesson learned. i couldn't focus. 
    * [[2024-07-03]]
      * morning shower
      * finally put kb on mechmarket. dont like how much of morning that took rip
      * added sent and planned pings to user page. pondered on next steps (attempting to wrap up so can deploy instead of scope creep...but hard). thinking back, i spent way too long on this pondering...but in the moment it felt quite necessary...so hmm idk. i even allowed myself to do that thinking bc it felt that important. the end result was my next tasks written out
      * went with Cristina to see nana, then went and had dinner at dads. Tried watching like 10 minutes of art tutorial, but then food was ready
      * now i could do art tuts or practice...but Tyler and gang is online, so i hop on to play games...so hard to get things done when you are connected
    * [[2024-07-04]]
      * watched 2 art tuts - one for procreate and one for contour drawing/continuous line drawing. btw contour = outline
      * spent rest of day trying to draw pics for one of my story ideas i had - the mapping feelings to what you want story
      * ended day with one more procreate tut - learned about clipping masks, transformations of warp and distort
    * [[2024-07-07]]
      * last days have mainly been family time since nana passed today
      * lots of reading Consider Phlebas, playing Neir Automata, and Fortnite
    * [[2024-07-10]]
      * spent last few days at James bc Monday i had cyst consult and today had ortho appointment. Finally back home now
      * all i did on that trip was: socialize with James, Quinn, wub and finally finish Consider Phlebas really
    * [[2024-07-12]]
      * went on run
      * finally shipped and got money for Moergo Glove80 keyboard

      * went to Hiros with Dad, John Parsons, Cindy, Cookie, Cristina, CJ, Benji, Papa, Payton

      * finally got Benny story put on paragraph and image put on X whyspia
    * [[2024-07-15]]
      * worked on whyspia emote all day. fixed notif system to store initial notif data. made so follow button works on planned pings on user page
    * [[2024-07-16]]
      * been brainstorming all day whether to do art or storywriting. tried doing art for memory art idea, but im too newb at art rn...so it doesnt really work. Even with reference it was rough. Think just need practice and maybe a book to teach me stuff maybe? but defs practice
      * i think plan may be to just do this: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking thoughts on creating art#^gqzKK8UUJ|maybe process ill continue with: find thing i wanna draw in some moment (like Japanese homes), practice getting reference of diff versions/perspectives of those and drawing them without much thought]] and then focus on storywriting during work time. Art will be more for relax time - not scheduled
    * [[2024-07-17]]
      * i lollygagged way too much today
      * canceled renter insurance
      * got search bar for planned pings working. Got delete of planned ping basically working. Did both these very quick
      * went on run
      * went to store for Cristina. Struggled to find ginger, garlic, and choyote
      * where did rest of my time go? i think social media and Joscha Bach hour long talk. Ohh that's right, i tried univerbal for a bit too, but not enough time to get much out of it - that was just before lunch
    * [[2024-07-18]]
      * woke up late and showered late bc damn clicking bug in ear i woke up to in middle of night
      * i mainly continued writing ultimate observer story today
      * got stuck and had bit of existential crisis when i had claude rewrite it and it was so much better. but i thinkkkk im over that now. leaving the ai tool rewrite for once i finish story in my own words completely
    * [[2024-07-19]]
      * fixed a few small things in whyspia
    * [[2024-07-20]]
      * got to see Lee in RP for first time in years! army guy now! Even bought a house and a car and lives with his dad. traveled and lived at multiple bases, Georgia, South Korea, and Fayetteville which is Fort Brag/Liberty. He liked Georgia best bc community and Korea worst bc lots of fighting and mean ppl. 
      * Cristina made brekky and pancit for lunch for me and Lee. i took to food lion first
    * [[2024-07-21]]
      * i tried using index network but couldn't find a usecase for myself sadly. like what do i need to stay up to date with?? maybe some space missions, but what would be url source to trac for that
      * got me some chocolate and cheese from whole foods after so long ðŸ¤¤ 
      * some fortnite wins bb
      * sketched out japanese house with reference but got bored of it once had to do windows, doors, and wall lines. Curious why i got bored
    * [[2024-07-22]]
      * spent entire morning down index network rabbit hole again. put my entire mind map in index and played with it. couldnt find any way to benefit from index sadly
      * after and before lunch became infatuated with a whyspia context or on shmoji site of a game corner - i set challenges and maybe for some will pay people to beat. For example, complete this trick jump in halo 3 and use mine. Or make webxr app trick jump. and have leaderboard connected to their x accounts
      * [[quests from shmoji]]
      * i mostly obsessed with above rest of day
    * [[2024-07-23]]
      * whyspia made single planned ping page and ability to copy link for them on profile page
      * cleaned up what do you desire screen and about pages a bit
      * think next step is adding things in to prevent api spammers and then figuring out how to get things online in cheapest manner
      * missed schedule of storywriting sadge
    * [[2024-07-27]]
      * had cyst surgery few days ago and havent done much since then except play Nier Automata
      * well, i did setup some EC2 instance stuff for whyspia, but not done yet
    * [[2024-07-28]]
      * finally got rid of that TV today. Lot of my soul in that TV.
      * played more Nier Automata
      * made decision to only eat dark choco when i really feel need for caffeine effect or really desire taste - but only every other day unless the pull is intense
      * pondered on format that will be best for me to create using on daily basis. moving towards making games again. had idea of still storywriting, but having NPCs that tell the stories bc something about that interaction is special even if just pressing button A ^DiVRS-ott
      * i spent time trying to draw chewing goku with reference
      * thought about feeling of either wanting adventure or wanting to protect, but having no idea how id fit that into my life
    * [[2024-08-06]]
      * pondered on conflict between sticking to schedule vs working on thing until steam runs out and then switching to do other stuff. for now i chose to go all in on one thing (whyspia) which neglects storywriting for now. not sure if this will stay my longterm, but at least rn it feels best. more intimate
      * built MVP for TAUs in whyspia
      * played Nier Automata for first time in many days
      * i didnt write here for days...im uncertain what i have been doing lol. i know Cookie and Payton visited tho
    * [[2024-08-07]]
      * bought Santa Barbara chocolate for first time
      * got notifs for TAUs in whyspia and context calcs in backend
      * got a run in
      * finally figured out a new spaced repetition system. At first i watched 2 anki videos and they helped none and just happened to bump into Roam spaced repetition plugin - and now im using that yay!
      * talking with papa about Tropical Storm Debbie
    * [[2024-09-04]]
      * today caught up with Jake after he just got out active combat zones in Africa
    * [[2024-10-07]]
      * well i submitted my Fulbright Grant application...but wont know if im semifinalist until Jan 25 and wont know if finalist until many months after that (as early as late February to as late as June) and program starts in September 2025. So i cant really count on that for what im doing and should do. I could wait all that time and just get rejected ^TQPZ2UKoW
      * INDEPENDENT RESEARCH: one thing im thinking i can do is look for more independent research opportunities and apply to those
      * GRAD SCHOOL: i think i might as well apply to all the grad schools ive looked into as well. Many of them said they are fully funded no matter what - like SFU under Carman and the other HCI labs in Canada and maybe one in New Zealand
      * opportunities in Japan ...altho have no idea what - i guess grad school there if can
      * somewhere i wrote out things i wanna finish before this arc ends and i still wanna do those: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking big life changes, options, questions, arc, next, trip#^GdYV9u6zm|before this break i still wanna do these at minimum:]]
      * i still really want a irl community
      * woops been mixing up this note and [[tracking big life changes, options, questions, arc, next, trip]]
    * [[2024-10-08]]
      * i looked into John Templeton independent research and then decided to check back another time - it's a lottt of writing for the application
      * i spent a lot of time with Grain the green anole in my room lol
      * finished reading all the weapon stories in [[nier automata]] - sooo good
      * played a lil [[Pokemon Scarlet-Violet]] - trying to catch em all
      * finished trying instantstyle on Pinokio and decided it wont work with that vram amount
      * looked into many comfui tutorials, but still not sure if i wanna go learn all that or not
    * [[2024-11-09]]
      * got Adobe Firefly today to try and create "nothing" that whyspia will originate from, but didnt work. Maybe i should create a actual spawn point first, like in halo 3 lol
      * this past week i finally got my Real id nice
      * did back and forth trying to get into endocrinologist
      * i learned a bit about prediction markets
      * aside from that stuff i have no idea where the rest of my time went lmao yikes, ill do better
    * [[2024-11-11]]
      * started grad app to SIAT SFU. Sent some questions through email to them before continuing. Before writing anything, they gotta pre-accept your app and you gotta pay 150USD nice
      * got PHPT appointment scheduled - gonna be expensive nice
    * [[2024-11-16]]
      * thinking about buying threejs course. i really just wanna be able to build 3D environments and that path seems somewhat clear, but i dont really understand how to build them in blender and then transfer to threejs and know/keep all positions relative and correct.
      * got rid of some old stuff in whyspia discord like sensei role and roles for getting notifications from me for "all content", "coding livestreams", and "gaming livestreams"
      * created whyspia dev page on X with hopes to spam progress on there

    * [[2025-03-09]]
      * just wanted to note i spent like 2 weeks just before Japan trip doing everything in my power to implement lit protocol encryption and Ceramic/ipfs storage for all data of whyspia...and failed
