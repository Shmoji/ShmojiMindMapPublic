      * Today James told me he puts clean dishes in dishwasher to dry and i didn't laugh. I felt awkward actually and stumbled on words bc i use dishwasher normally lol. But after thinking back, that's hilarious. But i didn't notice in the moment. Or maybe part of me did, but doesn't like hurting others so censored myself? But totally would've been better to not censor
      * Saw trailer for new game called OP - it was horrifying and that actually made me lol. Not sure why that made me lol like that. Guess i was just surprised by how good it was - good art, good at being horrifying

      * Goat Simulator. So stupid, which is so funny.
        * Found it funny pondering on dev that is treated like garbage in relation to not finishing creating goat that can shit on people before tuesday. Not funny enough to laugh tho
        * Seeing people getting rammed by goat got some chuckles
      * hearing neck massager say fckers - but not even a chuckle, but defs funny
      * in JJK episode, they spill coffee on Gojo's white shirt, try to pat it clean, it's terrible, and then Gojo walks in before they can fix it. Oh and shirt is stupid expensive. Gave me a lil chuckle out loud.
