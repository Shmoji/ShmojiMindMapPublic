        * ends up Shura's ancestors made pact with evil spirit - i think it basically gave her (maybe all these) fighting power or healing powers or eternal youngness and beauty while alive, BUT must die at 30 - and must have child to do same thing again ^tHPrzqWqG
        * Shura heard the evil spirit she in pact with was being searched so she went to protect i think
        * she fights spirit and it hurts her, but she heals quick since close to it
        * Yukio and Rin show up and are trying to figure out how to get her out of pact and make sure Illuminati dont get the spirit - bc they're looking for spirits with immortality right now and that's exactly what it is

        * woah we found out a lot more about the Blue Night - when blue flames of Satan engulfed and killed crap tons of people
        * this night was actually when Satan was born in clone experiments in Section 13 of the Asylum - what used to exist at True Cross Academy
        * Baals (not sure if same as demons) are immortal as concepts. Then they gained physical forms, but they died pretty quickly the more prominent a Baal they are
        * Lucifer died the quickest, like 1 decade life span
        * He despised this cruelty/unfairness and planned to kill everyone so everyone is just concepts again so fair playing field. and Mephisto told him to try creating clones which led to creation of Section 13
        * it sounded like most clones (maybe all of Lucifers) ended up with their own spirit, so no good as vessel
        * but also said Amaimon clone worked...so does that mean the spirit can always transfer to new clone vessels? was this similar for Satan? and Lucifer?
        * then what is difference in switching to clone vessel vs being reborn from concept to physical again??

        * Yukio's eye has activated. Satan wont let him kill himself. Yukio doesnt understand that subtle evil in him is Satan controlling him.
