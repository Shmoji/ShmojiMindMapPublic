          * Using this for creating things you want requires you to learn how to adjust the settings. Most useful seems to be making guidance_scale larger so it matches your prompt better (but this makes it less creative). Although, if you find seed with something close to what you want, that could be useful too
          * Seems turning guidance scale very high makes the output terrible and nowhere near prompt. Only slightly increasing seems better.
