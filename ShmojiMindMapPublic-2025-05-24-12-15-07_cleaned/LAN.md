  * what is LAN? #memo ^u5TVcVDtG
    * **Local Area Network**. It's a network that connects devices within a relatively small geographic area, such as a home, office, or building WITHOUT INTERNET. your home network is a LAN despite it mainly being for internet (tis optional to connect to interwebz)
    * i tend to think of it as the most physical network

      * Key Points about LAN:
        * **No Internet Required:** LANs don't require internet access. They are designed to enable devices (like computers, printers, phones) to communicate with each other locally, without needing to connect to the broader internet.
        * **Internal Communication:** Devices on a LAN can share resources, such as files, printers, and other services, directly with each other.
        * **Examples of Use:** Common examples include connecting devices within a home to share files or a printer, or within an office to access a shared server.
          * most common LAN: home internet
          * Q: how is a home wifi a LAN? isnt that a network provided by the internet? isnt the devices all connected bc the internet? ^00crFJG7V
            * GPT:
              * It's a common misconception that home Wi-Fi is provided by the internet, but in reality, the Wi-Fi network itself is a **Local Area Network (LAN)** that operates independently of the internet. i think realizing LAN is a local PHYSICAL system helps differentiate here. internet is too, but it's global and has LAN as lil connection subnetworks (dis b what WAN is)
              * Breaking it Down:
                * **Home Wi-Fi as a LAN:**
                  * When you set up a Wi-Fi router in your home, it creates a local network that allows all devices connected to it (like phones, laptops, smart TVs, etc.) to communicate with each other.
                  * This network is local to your homeâ€”hence, it's a Local Area Network (LAN).
                  * **Ethernet:** When you connect a device to your home router using an Ethernet cable, that device is connected to your **home LAN**. Ethernet is just another way to connect to the LAN, like Wi-Fi, but using a wired connection instead of wireless.
                * **Connection to the Internet:**
                  * The Wi-Fi router is usually connected to an internet service provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). This connection gives devices on the LAN access to the internet.
                  * However, the local communication between devices on the Wi-Fi network doesn't depend on the internet. For example, you can still share files, print documents, or play local multiplayer games even if the internet connection is down.
              * Example:
                * **Internet:** Think of the internet as a massive, global network that connects countless smaller networks together.
                * **LAN (Home Wi-Fi):** Your home Wi-Fi network is one of these smaller networks. It connects devices within your home, and if your router is connected to the internet, it extends that connectivity to the broader world.
      * LAN vs. Internet
        * **LAN:** A private network for local communication between devices.
        * **Internet:** A global network that connects many LANs and other networks together, allowing devices across the world to communicate.
      * In summary, LANs operate independently of the internet, though they can be connected to it. When a LAN is connected to the internet, devices on the LAN can access the internet, but LANs can also function entirely without it.
