      * framerate is aspect of GPU and CPU - not monitor
      * higher ur framerate, the more frames in one second (meaning more image details) ur monitor can POTENTIALLY display. it's literally more data/samples/images being displayed per second. Potential hinting at refreshrate
      * FPS = tells you how many frames per second the GPU is capable of processing and pushing out
      * GPU takes raw data from the CPU and processes it into the final image, which is sent to the monitor.
      * GPU used to have primary role of rendering frames, but now used for much more as seen with LLMs - like matrix operations. Also for being good at parallel processing
        * **CUDA/OpenCL**: Programming languages like CUDA (NVIDIA) and OpenCL allow developers to harness the power of the GPU for non-graphics applications by offloading specific tasks from the CPU to the GPU. idk how, but i know Quinn was using dis
        * **Tensor Cores**: NVIDIA and other manufacturers have added specialized cores within the GPU designed for machine learning tasks, significantly improving performance for AI-based applications and moving away from graphics cool
      * **Refresh rate** (Hz) is how many times a monitor refreshes its image/frame per second. If it finishes all frames, but still has more refreshes it doesnt just repeat last frame - it already knows this beforehand and instead will duplicate frames mathematically - showing more of each frame per second
        * Refresh rate is a feature associated with your monitor. Once the GPU processes the graphics/frames, it sends them straight to the monitor, and once the frames gets to the monitor, the monitor's refresh rate will determine the intervals at which the monitor displays them. Or basically, the refresh rate determines the speed at which the monitor displays each frame coming from the GPU.
      * Therefore, regardless of the frames produced by the GPU, the refresh rate of your monitor will be the determiner of how many of those frames are displayed. This is why it is recommended that you purchase a monitor in which the refresh rate is the same--if not more than--the FPS of your GPU. So, if your GPU has a frame rate of say 60FPS, you want the refresh rate of your monitor to be 60 Hz or more.
      * me: CPU observes all data. GPU PRODUCES frames from specific parts of all data at a certain rate. Monitor refreshes at a certain rate giving a rate for display
      * examples
        * So, assuming you have a 144 FPS GPU, and then you connect it to two monitors, say one has a refresh rate of 144Hz or higher and the second one has a refresh rate of 70 HZ. The monitor with the higher refresh rate (144 Hz or more) is going to pick up all the 144 frames produced by the GPU and then display them quicker. The monitor with the 70Hz refresh rate will only pick up 70 frames and also, it will display these frames more slowly, causing a lag. me: 1) literally less frames in 1 sec (less samples/data/details) 2) getting from 1 unique frame to the next actually will take longer (more slowly) - so u are staring at each frame longer which i guess is less data for your brain?? kinda like a delay - like that frame doesnt need to be shown that long - and bc it is, it may seem less smooth or like lag (but also totally new frames are skipped and not even shown compared to ppl with higher frames - so details/images missing addition to lag)
        * Similarly, assuming you have a GPU with a frame rate of say 48 fps, and then you connect it to two monitors; one with a refresh rate of say 144 Hz and the other with a refresh rate of say 70 Hz. Well, even though both monitors will pick up all the frames produced by the GPU (they will have the same FPS or image detail), the monitor with a higher refresh rate will display a smoother image or video than the one with a lower refresh rate (barely tbh)
      * Q: framerate is samples of what? refreshrate is samples of what?
        * framerate is samples of dynamic scene (game/video) DATA by GPU passed from CPU. each sample is image - each image is certain type/category of data from CPU
        * refreshrate is samples of time by monitor - updating display at end of each sample-time unit even if no content has changed (no new frames from GPU)
        * comparing to a self - framerate is kinda how much display-input can be taken in (conscious or not) and refreshrate is kinda how much display-input can be observed by you consciously. i could be wrong about this, but GPT liked it and responded with smthn cool tbh
          * related post that spawned: have you ever met someone where you see they consciously arent taking in that much data (in their awareness) - but you see they are taking in more data than most people unconsciously?
      * **Response Time** is how quickly a pixel can change from one color to another, typically measured in milliseconds (ms). It affects how smooth motion appears, especially during fast-paced content like gaming or action movies.
        * Q: but wouldnt each pixel change at time of each refresh?
          * It's a common misconception that every pixel on a display changes at the exact moment of each refresh.
          * **Pixel Update Timing**: Each pixel may not change simultaneously at the refresh interval. Instead, the display may update pixels in sequence or in groups. This can lead to a situation where not all pixels have had the chance to change color by the end of the refresh cycle. This can result in motion blur or ghosting effects during fast-moving scenes.
          * Q: what happens if this situation happens? will it just update pixel colors in next refresh or will it just stop the update?
            * the update doesnâ€™t stop; the pixels that missed the change will still be corrected in the following refresh cycle, though this may contribute to temporary visual artifacts like ghosting or blur. Ghosting happens when pixels are still transitioning while new frame data is being drawn, creating a trailing effect behind fast-moving objects.
            * me: dese pixels over hur very different from last frame after fast movement...ooo same for these over here where visual object moved from. all dese pixels in diff areas still transitioning from colorPrev to colorNext - causing blur bc kinda looks like old frame kinda looks like new frame
            * Q: "you can see part of the previous frame while the new frame is already being displayed" so is ghosting more bc that pixel is from previous frame somewhat ( in-between state) whereas many other pixels are already the new frame - and that creates contrast that shows as ghosting?
              * A: YES. GPT: This contrast between pixels that are properly updated and those that are lagging behind is what causes the visible "trail" or ghosting effect behind fast-moving objects. So, ghosting isn't about mixing two frames on the same pixel, but about certain pixels not transitioning quickly enough to match the rest of the frame, making them appear out of sync and creating the trailing effect.
            * Q: why does it stick out for fast-moving objects? maybe cuz we just wouldnt really notice for slow moving objects even if response time bad?
              * YES. And the contrast has to do with position of visual objects it seems.
              * GPT:
              * Ghosting sticks out more for fast-moving objects because the faster an object moves, the larger the position gap between where it was in one frame and where it is in the next. If a pixel hasn't fully transitioned to display the new frame, the **lagging pixels** create a noticeable trail between the previous and current positions of the moving object.
              * For slow-moving or static objects, the difference between consecutive frames is much smaller, so even if the pixels are slow to update, you wouldn't notice as much because the image hasn't changed significantly between frames. In that case, any lingering effects blend in and don't create the obvious position contrast and trail that fast motion does.
              * In short, the **motion amplifies the visibility** of ghosting because the eye is better at detecting a mismatch when there's a large, rapid change in an object's position (tldr: big contrast in position of pixels attached to visual objects)
        * typical response times are between 1ms-30ms
