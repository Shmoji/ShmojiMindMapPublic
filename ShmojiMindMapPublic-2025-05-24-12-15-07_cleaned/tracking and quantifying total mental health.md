          * Intensity today was like 5/10. Physical pain about 7/10, so sure that's a causer too. However, somehow the subtle thought and realization of "1) wabisabi (for the specific bad moments) 2) it is what it is 3) needing to spread more love bc other people are hurting in same way or more - but cant do that if im focused on negative self talk" - led to intensity going to 1/10. Was also listening to Notam of Wind og soundtrack when realization came.

        * past few weeks have seemed almost bipolar most days. Today, i decided to not drink Oolong tea in morning. Mood was stable whole day and felt gr8. Oolong tea has moderate caffeine content. Caffeine may be the asshole here. Will keep tracking.

        * Was in pain from CIRS today - lots of chronic fatigue. But also mentally unwell. Now that im typing it, i dont think mood was variable tho - i was consistently miserable entire day at office. I did get a reduction of misery while reading Baghavad Gita and heard to put focus on "the all" that is nondual instead of focus being on x task at hand (which task is often to put focus on "the all"...lol)

        * Will maybe make into category eventually, but today was grumpy. More details: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/2023-10-01#^mQVvrKNVe|oh shoot i just realized i started a new medicine this morning required to do a certain lab test. I started feeling grumpy around lunch. I didn't even think about the medicine causing it. More specifically i feel like i couldn't et comfortable ever despite desperately seeking it. Examples: eating all the food, but barely enjoying it. Watching comfort shows but no comfort. ]]

        * Today i felt on and off depressed. But ive also felt on and off sick. All are common of my chronic issues, EXCEPT on an off sore throat - thaz not common. 
        * Around 2am my sinuses were really killing me and v tired. So much i felt need to take 15 minute nap during work.
        * Around 5-8pm felt some like 5-6/10 depression or mental badness. 
        * My only guesses for why: 1) im sick 2) i ate cod liver at lunch so maybe thaz why idk
        * around 10pm had 5/10 chronic fatigue and 4-5/10 throat and sinus pain - interesting
