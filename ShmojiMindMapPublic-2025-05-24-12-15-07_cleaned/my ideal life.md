  * journal on my ideal life
    * [[2023-09-28]]
      * im noticing everything i want has to be built by me with story. There is no precise way for me to get community. I would have to build the community i want (unless vibecity becomes a real thing)
      * There is no precise way for me to get consistent adventure. I have found ways to get it through meetups tho - which is almost good enough. But to get it to a point im happy with ill have to build some way to get that adventure.
  * my ideal life (more realistic)
    * COMMUNITY: my home is in a community very similar to my dorm in college
      * i live in a building together with people that interact daily (dorm)
      * i live in a larger area of people that often interact (college campus)
      * the precise desires of the people in this community align quite a bit with my desires. For example, i can list all my desires and list all the actions i take on a daily basis based on those desires. Now match me with people that are similar
    * ADVENTURE: i have some source of various people going on adventures daily that i can join in on or not join in on
      * adventures could be anything from hiking, to gaming, to social events, to cuddling, to lust, to food, to etc
    * CLOSENESS/ROMANCE/LOVE: i have best friend(s) or romantic partner(s)
      * i interact with them daily or at least 2-4 times per week
  * my ideal life (less realistic)
    * death is cured
    * Everyone has access to safe high-bandwidth BCI
  * my ideal life (abstract)
    * the number of opportunities i receive over time is optimal
      * how is this different from my life now?
        * I go to a job every week day 8-5 that doesnt have much meaning for me or anyone else. This means my only opportunities are closed off to that job during those hours
        * Death is not cured, so that limits my opportunities
    * i have the ability to choose any opportunity i want at any time
    * i have the ability to cancel any opportunity at any time
  * related
