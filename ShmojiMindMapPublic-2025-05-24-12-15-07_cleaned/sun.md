  * what is it useful for?
    * it gives us a steady stream of low [[entropy]] (from Veritasium vid on entropy) - so concentrated bundled-up energy.
      * the energy we get from the sun is more useful than the energy we give back out to space
      * plants capture this energy and use it to grow and create sugars. Then animals eat plants and use that energy to maintain body and move around. bigger animals eat smaller animals. Each step of the way, energy becomes more spread out
      * questions
        * isn't it only low entropy from our perspective?
  * key points
    * Earth is not a closed system because we have the sun
