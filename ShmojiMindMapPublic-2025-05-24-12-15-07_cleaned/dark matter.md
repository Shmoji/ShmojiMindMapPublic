  * interesting notes
    * NGC 1277 contains several times the mass of the Milky Way but an absence of dark matter. It's considered a "relic galaxy," which has had few interactions with its neighbors, which could help explain the absence of dark matter.
      * this is 2023. Previously, only some dwarf galaxies had no dark matter
