  * what i KNOW i want in Chronic

    * Just like SM64, player spawns into world and then can start exploring. Just like SM64 castle, there's a central area.
    * Emo main character

Press M on it and move to new 'background' collection. Use clear tools to put it in default positions (Alt+buttons). Scale it larger and rotate 90 degrees around X-axis. Use G to move frontview of character so it's feet are just above X-axis. Go to side view and use G along Y-axis to move concept back a bit]]

Add loopcut horizontally in middle and scale out on X-axis. Top is a bit big so use Alt+Z for X-ray Mode and scale in using X-axis. Do tons of scaling and moving until you like it. Can add two more loopcuts if you want it even more accurate, but don't recommend too many loopcuts.]]
