  * what is it?
    * ME: experiencer, experience, multiple pieces of info all in one single experience
    * ME: seems it's less about memories and more about binding sensory info into one unified experience (but im not confident here). Multiple parts of brain process different sensory input, but then somehow that is all binded together into one experience.
    * ME: almost feels like this problem is just "who is the observer"
    * How objects, background and abstract or emotional features are combined into a single experience.
  * types of binding
    * Global Binding refers to the fact that several units of information can be present simultaneously within experience. The task of explaining how this is possible philosophically and neuroscientifically is called the Binding Problem.
    * Local Binding refers to the phenomenon by which several units of information are perceived as unified within experience. For example, the human visual field contains more information than just a flat image. A cup is usually perceived as a unified object, despite consisting of many pixels -- i.e., the pixels are locally bound into a unified percept. It's common to describe these composite percepts as a single quale.
