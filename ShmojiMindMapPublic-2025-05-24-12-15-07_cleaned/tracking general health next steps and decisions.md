  * tracking next steps and decisions
    * [[2024-02-28]]
      * i finished sibo protocol and hydrogen numbers only slightly improved. idek if i believe i have sibo. im gonna stop with sibo and cirs for now
      * gonna try acupuncture for my current health issues that bother me
      * also gonna do therapy and see if that has effects just in case
      * just got bottom braces, so maybe once jaw is fixed, that will change things too - maybe im not breathing correctly - have read those stories online
      * will go from there
    * [[2024-03-25]]
      * i finished colostrum - which maybe made constipation a bit better, but idk
      * gonna finally go back to acupuncture now that im supplement free. hopefully my finances can handle it despite about to be unemployed
      * therapy is going super well. discovering my parts and have a mental tool for my anxiety now - no huge breakthroughs yet tho. will also have to sadly cancel this due to unemployment
    * [[2024-04-03]]
      * im in acupuncture - done 2/10 sessions so far
      * just started supplement from acupuncture today. It is San Ren Tang. 4 tsp of it in warm water twice per day and then one whole cup of water right after. Think supposed to be for digestion
    * [[2024-04-18]]
      * finished San Ren Tang in last few days
      * feels like my bloating is about fixed. Sinusitis almost feels worse some days. Pooping is same i think but maybe slighty better. Still get stomach gurgling often, especially during night
      * still have like a month of acupuncture left
    * [[2024-04-20]]
      * starting new supplement from acupuncture today called Xiao Yao San. 8 spoons twice per day.
      * Realized they did not give me the spoon. I called and he said their spoon is 1 gram. He said instead i can do 1 tsp twice per day It will be lil less than preferred, but not bad. I googled and 1 tsp seems be about 4 grams. So seems ill be doing 4 grams twice per day instead of 8 twice per day until next appointment. im chill starting small tbh
    * [[2024-04-30]]
      * finished Xiao Yao San yesterday. Today started Yi Gan San 8 spoons twice per day
      * tbh it's possible he's mixing some of these together, so this isnt even the supp labeled on bottle, but idk
    * [[2024-05-07]]
      * finished Yi Gan San today
      * Starting another Yi Gan San at 2.5 spoons twice daily and San Ren Tang at 2.5 spoons twice daily
    * [[2024-05-09]]
      * went in for cyst removal but it was still too painful even after numbing so i had to cancel
      * Rho said i would need to see a plastic surgeon to get these removed while unconscious. She recommended Laura someone. Said would put in referral but idk if they actually did.
    * [[2024-10-31]]
      * really all im doing right now iz typical protocols and braces
      * HOWEVER, research is saying a potential dx could be primary hyperparathyroidism - but literally just learned about it so take with grain of salt
      * primary hyperparathyroidism: an enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands cause overproduction of parathyroid hormone. This causes high calcium levels in blood
      * oh wow: ive had tons of thyroid tests, but never PTH levels test which is main test for primary hyperparathyroidism
      * i dont think i have SECONDARY hyperparathyroidism bc i would have low calcium levels, but historically ive had HIGH LEVELS of calcium which is a key sign of the primary version (or inappropriately normal PTH level in the presence of high calcium)
      * there's actually many ways to test - if i go to doc, make sure they know of all ways to test - i have perplexity chat here i asked how to test
      * there's a specific kind called Hyperparathyroidismâ€“jaw tumor syndrome - think could be useful to look into this due to all my dental issues/pain and jaw pain and throat pain. Apparently often presents in late adolescence or early adulthood...like me lol. There is genetic component - Caused by mutations in the CDC73 gene, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern - altho i wonder if stupid tooth infection while young can cause too
    * [[2024-11-20]]
      * okay got the tests for hyperparathyroidism and seems to not be me bc my PTH levels are LOW - almost too low, but just in range.
      * tbh my attention has turned back to fungal infections
      * im wondering: are there any fungal infections related to:
        * low PTH levels
        * high calcium levels
        * low vitamin D levels
        * sinusitis (and all details of mine specifically)
        * calcium oxalate kidney stones
        * polyuria
      * important imo SOMETHING is increasing my calcium levels (leading to stones) and SOMETHING is causing details of my sinusitis
      * for my safety from heavy metals im gonna start only eating [[chocolate]] every 3 days starting today
    * [[2024-12-17]]
      * okay my referal to Dr Perfect was declined bc he is not taking new patients. AND my referral was declined in general for any docs there. BUT i can have referring doc call and talk to see if they can change their mind i guess
      * i just wanna see a doc specialized in fungal infections sheeesh
      * Barbara Dudley Alexander seemed like good option, but doesnt resonate. Gary M. Cox, MD seems like good option and does resonate
      * it seems like it may end up being too hard to get into Duke. i probably could by calling and getting email to send records of my stones and sinusitis to them...but idk if that's the move now
      * was also considering seeing ENT focused on fungal infections. Found this place: https://www.raleighcapitolent.com/patient-information/request-appointment-klara
      * every ENT ive ever seen was awful and useless, but since they focus on fungal stuff, maybe there is hope
      * if anything, just wanna get a sinus culture...youd think that would be easy
      * STOPPED: well, guess im stopped for now on next steps (with plans to maybe continue with Raleigh place above in January)
