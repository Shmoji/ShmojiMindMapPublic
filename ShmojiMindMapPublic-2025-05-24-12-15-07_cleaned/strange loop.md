  * what it be
    * A LOOP...DUH: situations where, whenever movement is made upwards or downwards through the levels of some hierarchical system, the system unexpectedly arrives back at the starting point. It seems like you're making progress, but then you end up back where you started.
  * examples
    * For example, in a piece of visual art, a strange loop might be represented by a drawing that contains a smaller version of the drawing within itself in a way that the "inside" and "outside" become indistinguishable. This concept is often seen in the works of Dutch artist M.C. Escher.
    * In mathematics and logic, the concept of a strange loop is closely related to the self-referential paradoxes of GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems.
