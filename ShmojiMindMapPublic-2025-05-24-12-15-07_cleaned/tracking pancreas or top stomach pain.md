  * tracking when it happened to me

      * pain or soreness or tension at top stomach is about 3-4/10 today. It's bad enough where i dont even wanna move around too much and certain movements hurt. It feels kinda like pancreas is swollen and sore, so if a movement pushes bones into it - then ouch
      * I guess it makes sense because lipase and amylase are very high which signals pancreas issues. What doesn't make sense is what triggered it: my only guess is Lipid Rescue - but internet says that's unlikely

      * Since last time has stayed consistent. Although, most of day around 2/10. In evening it's around 3-4/10.

Possible reasons for improvement 1) stopped mycopul yesterday 2) got lot of poop out this morning lol 3) something in Moes homewrecker bowl? 4) rng]]

      * Still having this. Often only feel it when sitting up straight in chair, but around 3-4/10 at most intense.
      * Met Dr today. She said lipase/amylase/pancreas issues could be unrelated to CIRS. Need to test for SIBO because gut inflammation can cause pancreas inflammation. Also need to solve SIBO issues before CSM (i think is what she said)

      * it started a few days ago and no idea why. Nothing changed except i ate shomai (dumplings from Cristina)
      * another idea: been taking tablespoon of black seed oil for a week or so. But doubt it causes it
      * been 1-3/10 pressure at top tummy
