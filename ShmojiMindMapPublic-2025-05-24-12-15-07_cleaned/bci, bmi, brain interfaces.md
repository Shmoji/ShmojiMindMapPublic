        * with BCI it's hard to execute your pre-defined commands if they aren't coupled to the environment you're currently in. Learned this when making my first command with the Emotiv Epoc X
        * also, i noticed that sensations in your body work realllyyyy well for command activation. Example: turn my room light on whenever i feel tension in my spine. What worked best for me to lift digital cube was to sit up straight, feel that tension in my spine, imagine halo 3 gravity lift under the cube, dont resist any senses im taking in, and make clear my goal to lift the cube
        * also, i noticed that sensations in body work realllyy well for command activation. Ex: turn room light on whenever i feel tension in spine. What worked best for me to lift digital cube was to:
          * - sit up straight
          * - feel that tension in my spine
          * - imagine halo 3 gravity lift under the cube
          * - dont resist any senses im taking in
          * - make clear my goal to lift the cube
        * important to do all those at same time

  * speculative questions
    * if you have bci and want to implant knowledge instantly into your mind, do you need a first person experience to implant that knowledge? 
      * if yes: would you be able to gain a first person experience that lasted lets say 10 years in a matter of seconds in your time? what are the effects of that on you? would that experience then feel like YOURS or would it feel fake?
      * if no: how dat work?
  * questions
    * what do bci devices like those produced by OpenBCI read from your brain?
      * GPT4:
        * Electrical Activity (EEG): The primary method used by BCIs like OpenBCI is electroencephalography (EEG). EEG measures the electrical activity in the brain. This activity is represented by waves of varying frequencies, which are associated with different types of brain functions and states, such as alertness, relaxation, or different stages of sleep.
        * Event-Related Potentials (ERPs): These are brain responses that are directly the result of a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event. By analyzing ERPs, BCIs can interpret responses to specific stimuli or actions.
        * Brainwave Patterns: Specific patterns of brain activity, often categorized by their frequency ranges like alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and theta waves. Each of these ranges is associated with different types of brain activities. For example, alpha waves are often linked with relaxation, while beta waves are associated with focused activity.
        * Oximetry Data (in some advanced systems): Some sophisticated BCIs might also use methods like functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure blood oxygen levels in the brain, which can give insights into brain activity.
        * Muscle Activity (EMG) and Eye Movements (EOG): While not directly reading brain activity, some BCIs also incorporate electromyography (EMG) to measure muscle activity and electrooculography (EOG) to track eye movements, as these can be relevant in understanding overall neural activity and intention.
