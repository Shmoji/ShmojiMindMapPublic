  * list of hints my issues is fungal (if i prove one wrong, i will remove it or add to list of removed hints)
    * D-ARABINITOL: very high D-Arabinitol - 51 value in range of <=36 (from Metabolomix urine results). This biomarker is known in regards to fungal infections

Verrucarin A, Verrucarin J, Satratoxin G, Satratoxin H, Isosatratoxin F - Procedure by ELISA
      * from overall Realtime Labs Mycotoxin urine test
      * my value: 0.16ppb and bad is >=0.09ppb according to test
    * high Gliotoxin Derivative in mycotoxins urine test
      * specific test: Gliotoxin Derivative - Procedure by ELISA
      * from overall Realtime Labs Mycotoxin urine test
      * my value: 1.273ppb and bad is >=1ppb according to test
    * high Zearalenone in mycotoxins urine test
      * specific test: Zearalenone - Procedure by ELISA
      * from overall Realtime Labs Mycotoxin urine test
      * my value: 0.77ppb and bad is >=0.7ppb according to test
    * CALCIUM OXALATE KIDNEY STONES: i have rather high calcium for no reason. i have rather high oxalates for no reason. Maybe some fungi is producing oxalates or increasing calcium somehow - or BOTH
    * HYDROGEN PRODUCING BACTERIA: my test for SIBO is positive for hydrogen producing bacteria. [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/biomarkers that may be issue#^RBndUMM_X|POSITIVE for hydrogen producing bacteria (as measured by triosmart breath test). Expected <25.77ppm, but had 66.50 ^RBndUMM_X]]
    * SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking hints my issue is fungal, what ive tried for the fungal path#^uXbk7gxEo|swollen lymph nodes under my jaw/in neck - seen in 2 different ultrasounds.

    * GARLIC REACTIONS: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking hints my issue is fungal, what ive tried for the fungal path#^qPZWgBiyp|i THINK garlic consistently triggers the pain in my throat and nose and sinuses. im not confident in this yet tho. BUT if it's true, garlic is known as an antifungal]]
    * CHRONIC SINUS INFECTIONS for years
    * inflammation in nose and throat seen consistently through various scans and tubes put inside the holes of my body
  * tracking what ive tried for the fungal path
    * LAURICIDIN MONOLAURIN: i took [[Lauricidin Monolaurin]] for a long time with no effect
    * CANDIBACTIN-AR: i took CANDIBACTIN-AR from Metagenics for long time with no effect
    * BERBERINE: i took BERBERINE 900 MG per pill (Berberine Complex from Integrative Therapeutics) for long time with no effect
    * BIOFILM DISRUPTOR NAC: i took biofilm disruptor - NAC for long time with no effect
    * NYSTATIN: took Nystatin for 10 days and nothing changed at all
    * MYCOPUL: took Mycopul for 3 month and not a solution - although it maybe helped with severe chronic muscle weakness at that time
  * tracking hints my issue is fungal and tryna figure it out

      * i THINK garlic consistently triggers the pain in my throat and nose and sinuses. im not confident in this yet tho. BUT if it's true, garlic is known as an antifungal ^qPZWgBiyp
      * swollen lymph nodes under my jaw/in neck - seen in 2 different ultrasounds. Maybe fungal lymph infection?? ^uXbk7gxEo
      * bc i have high Gliotoxin Derivative, research says this could be due to molds such as *Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Aspergillus flavus* - bc of this, im gonna make a list of possible molds/fungi that may be terrorizing me: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking hints my issue is fungal, what ive tried for the fungal path#^DBSwy3JfH|list of possible molds/fungi that may be terrorizing me]]

  * possible paths to try out
    * itraconazole - BUT im scared of this path bc iz kinda drug that seems like it can do more harm literally to random organs than good
  * list of possible molds/fungi that may be terrorizing me ^DBSwy3JfH
    * Aspergillus fumigatus
      * hinted due to high Gliotoxin Derivative in mycotoxin urine test
    * Aspergillus flavus
      * hinted due to high Gliotoxin Derivative in mycotoxin urine test
    * genera Stachybotrys
      * hinted due to high Trichothecene Group (Macrocyclic) in mycotoxin urine test
    * genera Myrothecium
      * hinted due to high Trichothecene Group (Macrocyclic) in mycotoxin urine test
    * Fusarium
      * hinted due to high Zearalenone in mycotoxin urine test
  * good questions i think ive asked
    * do any of the fungi above produce oxalates in the body?
      * *Aspergillus flavus*, *Stachybotrys* (to a lesser extent), and *Fusarium* are associated with oxalate production. *Aspergillus fumigatus* and *Myrothecium* are less likely to produce significant amounts of oxalates.
      * Fusarium stuck out the most to me while researching - said something like Fusarium literally creates oxalates during its metabolism
    * could any of these stay in the human gut or human sinuses or other body part for several years without constant exposure (so person is traveling and not just stuck in exposure)?
      * **Aspergillus fumigatus**, **Aspergillus flavus**, and **Fusarium**
      * again Fusarium stuck out to me most during research
