  * what is it?
    * My definition: system gives energy to its surroundings. Goes from inside to outside. Whereas, [[endothermic]] means some system absorbs energy from outside; it goes from outside to inside
    * In thermodynamics, the term exothermic process (exo- : "outside") describes a process or reaction that releases energy from the system to its surroundings, usually in the form of heat, but also in a form of light (e.g. a spark, flame, or flash), electricity (e.g. a battery), or sound (e.g. explosion heard when burning hydrogen)
    * Simply stated, after an exothermic reaction, more energy has been released to the surroundings than was absorbed to initiate and maintain the reaction...reminds me of [[fire]]
