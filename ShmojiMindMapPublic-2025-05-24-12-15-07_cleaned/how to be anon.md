  * questions
    * can a router and modem only send signals out or can it search for nearby devices itself?
      * me: basically it could, but requires additional software or firmware. You know there's loopholes that could allow central entities like the gov to do that shit. But would defs be hard. Good to keep in mind tho.

        * a router, by default, doesn't scan for devices that are not broadcasting a signal seeking connection.
        * actively searching for nearby devices that are not attempting to connect to the network would require additional software or firmware modifications. This is not a standard feature of routers and would be a highly unusual and complex undertaking.
    * if you truly want a device to be anon - how do you even connect it to the internet?
      * me: seems you cant connect to YOUR networks bc then your device is linked to that network. You could spoof your MAC before joining network - but that device is still detected.
