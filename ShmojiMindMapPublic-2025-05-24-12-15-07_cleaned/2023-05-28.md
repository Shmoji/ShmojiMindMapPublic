    * noticed whenever i consume sugary stuff sometimes that seems to trigger lymph nodes to swell in throat/jaw and bit of pain there. For example, have noticed this after drinking peanut butter smoothie and after eating protein bar. So could be the protein, the sugar, or something else

    * observation: been procrastinating replacing the water filter for like months, SUCH a simple task. Maybe takes like a minute. So why the procrastination of an easy task? Also key to note that ive never done this particular easy task before. 
    * Going forward, lets track if i always dread or procrastinate easy tasks. Is it only easy tasks i have no experience with or all?
