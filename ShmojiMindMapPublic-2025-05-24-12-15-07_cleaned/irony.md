  * what is irony
    * [[2024-10-17]] rando reddit person - what is irony, opposite, expectation, kinda, contrast, sarcasm #[[fast memo]]
      * DEFINITION: when something happens (outcome) that is the OPPPOSITE of what is expected instead of just kinda unexpected. It can be funny, but it can also be tragic. Irony has STRONG contrast due to it being OPPOSITE. EX: fail vs success. black vs white. 0 or 1. Unexpected does not always have that strong contrast - could be weak
      * contrast = 2 things differ very much if high/strong
      * Sarcasm, where the real meaning is the opposite of the surface meaning, can be a type of verbal irony, but it’s not the only type of verbal irony.
      * In dramatic irony the audience knows what to expect (they think they do bc they have more info than characters), but the characters on stage do not. Thus the audience knows Juliet took a sleeping potion and isn’t really dead when Romeo discovers her lifeless body, but Romeo does not and kills himself (it wasnt ironic for him). In this case, the **dramatic irony** intensifies the tragedy because the audience has more info and knows what **should** happen (Romeo realizing Juliet is alive) but witnesses the **opposite** (Romeo mistakenly thinking she’s dead and killing himself). tis dramatic bc observer has more info and thinks they know what to expect, but dont!
      * ex: Using the words "Yeah, ur right" to mean "No, ur incorrect" is an example of verbal irony - and sarcasm!
      * since irony is high contrast, it is often high surprise. Altho not always bc sarcasm if bad is expected and not surprising (altho maybe that means its no longer sarcasm/irony) - if good it is surprising tho lol - hence funny or tragic
      * Q: when something is being done non-ironically, what does that mean
        * GPT: 
        * When something is done **non-ironically**, it means that it is done sincerely and without sarcasm, mockery, or hidden meanings (not going for opposite of expectations). The person performing the action genuinely means or believes what they are doing, without any hint of humor or satire.
        * For example, if someone wears a piece of clothing non-ironically, they genuinely like it and are not doing it to make fun of fashion trends or for comedic effect. The opposite, doing something *ironically*, would mean that they are doing it with an intention to amuse or mock (going for opposite of expectations for a reason), often knowing that it might seem absurd or out of place.

          * yea i think irony doesnt have to be black and white - there can be spectrum. But really just depends how you personally wanna define it. This is where whether it is good or not comes in - based around how expected it is or isnt - the contrast of expectation
          * added Q on non-ironically
        * [[2024-12-10]]
          * maybe it's not GOOD sarcasm or GOOD irony if i expected it. OR maybe it still can be good despite me expecting it if OTHER PEOPLE still didnt expect it, despite me knowing
