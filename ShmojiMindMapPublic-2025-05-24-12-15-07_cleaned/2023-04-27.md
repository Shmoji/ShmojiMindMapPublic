    * Just birthed stone. It was stuck in urethra for few days. Holding in pee and then blasting helps a lot. Someone on reddit recommended to hold penis shut and start to pee and let penis fill with pee and hopefully that expands urethra so stone passes. i somewhat tried that and did indeed pass stone just now
    * When stone was less than 5mm, going through urethra wasnt toooo bad. But this stone was greater than 5mm and the multiple days it took to get through urethra felt like a sand spur that was stuck. Painful in a different way, but still not as bad as low back pain when it's in kidney and ureter. Also, when in urethra, it mainly only hurts when peeing.
