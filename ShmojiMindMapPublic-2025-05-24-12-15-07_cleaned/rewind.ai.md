  * what is it?
    * the TRACKING aspect: tech that sits on your device and tracks EVERYTHING. It tracks your entire screen and everything on it. I think it tracks your voice and any other audio. Not sure if it records through your webcam at all times - feels like that would be too heavy on hardware, but who knows.
    * the directly USEFUL aspect: you can now remember anything that the tracking tech has captured. You can ask questions like you would to ChatGPT and get answers. For example, say you had a meeting with your team, but dont remember what your boss said. You could ask questions through the chatbot to figure it out.
  * issues
    * only available on certain Apple devices at the moment. I think it's only on Apple devices with the M1 or M2 chips or whatever
  * concerns (potential issues)
    * The team says they are privacy-first, but can that really be trusted?
      * They seem honest, but you never know
      * Even if they are honest, you can always be hacked.
        * But tbh who cares. Why would it hurt you if someone got all that data? I can think of some examples, but the value of the tech seems very worth it.
      * In regards to what data leaves your machine, the team says that only the text from your chatbot convos is sent to OpenAI. No video recordings or audio files ever leave your machine.

    * wouldnt the storage of all the stuff being tracked eventually be WAY too much?
      * their answer: Storing all the recordings locally means compression is very important. We compress raw recording data up to 3,750x times without major loss of quality. For example, 10.5GB of raw recording data becomes 2.8MB. That means that even with the smallest hard drive you can buy from Apple today, you can store years of recordings.
      * You can probably find some way to remove data locally and store somewhere else and then only bring it back local when you need it (but i have no idea on details of how - maybe ill find out one day if i use this)
    * wouldnt all this tracking be tough on your hardware?
      * their answer: The key enabling technology that makes Rewind possible is Apple Silicon. We utilize virtually every part of the System on a Chip (SoC) so that running Rewind doesnâ€™t tax system resources (like CPU and memory) while it is recording. It feels virtually imperceptible.
  * pricing
    * Seems pretty reasonable tbh and they even have a free option to try it out
    * Can find pricing on their site
  * Other really cool stuff
    * Every answer from the chatbot (they call Ask Rewind) includes direct links to the very moments in time that shaped the response.
  * why im bullish on this project
    * let this sink in: rewind.ai together with Apple Vision Pro
    * it's just so darn valuable to be able to automate remembering things
