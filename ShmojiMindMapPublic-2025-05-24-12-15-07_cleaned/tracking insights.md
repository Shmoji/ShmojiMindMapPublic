    * [[2025-05-09]] proof of ANYTHING by ONE DEVICE is thanks to blockchain #memeit
      * blockchain is the key to proof of anything when thinking VERY longterm

1000000 years from now, any person can access any data from the chain from ONE single device

i think the blockweave is better for more diverse data (store literally anything) and more longterm if you ASSUME the network stays up. But if it doesnt, one single device prob isnt gonna be able to access data tbh
      * this insight came after i considered the last question in this art:
        * can you imagine many millennia from now...humanity went extinct before any sort of mergers with silicon...BUT we did successfully birth silicon intelligence
        * can you imagine the silicon intelligence trying to prove (to their own kind or to aliens) that their creators existed
        * other silicon intelligence sitting there like: "yeaaaa sure buddy"
        * like how would they know the history about humans is real and not just synthetic data?
      * side memes
        * millennium - just like mm vs um...milli actually means thousand years...not million. Millennium falcon is C-shaped rebel ship. Millennium Puzzle is pyramid necklace in yugioh...although there's seven millennium items all used for locking up yugioh game
