      * Trent from Ocean:
        * None of the research on implants or optogenetics is (officially) aimed at healthy humans; it’s all for fixing human ailments.
        * Why? Because it’s already super-hard to get regulatory approval for human trials for the latter; going for the former has seemed unattainable.
        * Why? Put yourself in the shoes of a regulator. You’re used to balancing risk vs reward for a narrowly-scoped problem to fix a specific human medical ailment. You’re *not *used to balancing risk vs reward for a *civilization*-scoped issue, to avoid a *non-medical* existential risk for all Humanity. (Despite being the gatekeeper for that.)
        * So what do you do? You focus on what you know, and dismiss away the existential risk. This has a term: [[bike shedding]]. When a safety committee for a nuclear power plants spends 95% of its time discussing the bike shed because they aren’t equipped to do anything about the big hairy nuclear risk issue.
        * BCI research is being bike-shedded right now. I’m hopeful that this will change as regulators and their higher-ups recognize the issue.

      * Hyper-localized AI Alignment: personal ai for each human
        * Trent from Ocean:
          * we ensure that processing or storage does *not* outpace bandwidth, at each evolutionary step along the way. This is no guarantee however: what if the silicon-side starts accessing way more compute from the internet?
          * This is different from traditional AI alignment approaches: here we are aligning the AI *in real time*, aligning it with our *selves*. It’s hyper-localized to each of us. It’s one aligned AI per human, rather than 1 or 10 for the human race. Therefore it’s 10 billion times more fine-grained and personalized. It’s AI alignment taken to the limit (in the calculus sense). There’s no guarantee that this will work. But it’s highly promising.
