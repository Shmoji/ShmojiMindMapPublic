  * anecdotes
    * Snowden recommends to not use wifi
      * only use ethernet plugged into #router. If plugged into #modem there is less security. And people can see all devices on your network, but not case with router apparently
      * Anyone in the world can see your network, you can literally search anyone and it's all tracked - all devices. But i guess ethernet is way for it to not be tracked - as long as plugged into router instead of modem. I think if someone had physical access to router, they could still get ya tho
  * why privacy and privacy tech is so important
    * our BCI need to have decentralized access, otherwise you will get the literal thought police (or worse, thought controllers/hackers)
