  * Benefits in sunlight at different times of day

    * Sunrise:
      * Huberman:
        * Viewing sunlight within the first hours of waking (as soon as you can, even if through cloud cover) **increases early-day cortisol release** (the ideal time for elevated cortisol) and prepares the body for sleep later that night. A morning spike in cortisol will also positively influence your immune system, metabolism and ability to focus during the day.
        * Further, morning sunlight helps regulate your “**circadian clock**” — the body’s mechanism for anticipating when to wake up and go to sleep — and it manages other biological processes like hunger and body temperature.
      * sets all circadian CLOCK genes in every organ of the body via blue with UVA and red/IR, ATP production, cellular hydration (coherent cellular water formation) via red/IR, red/IR + UVA for electron transport chain enzymes. Tells Brain to produce all steroid/adrenal hormones, thyroid hormones, and neurotransmitters. Begins NO and melatonin production for the day.
    * Midday:
      * UVB predominate with UVA, blue, green, red/IR. Vitamin D synthesis, more mitochondrial enzymes, microbiome modulation, continues to set circadian CLOCKs.
    * Sunset
      * Huberman:
        * The particular wavelengths of the sun when it is low in the sky (yellows and oranges, in contrast with blue) come through even if it’s overcast. Sunlight viewed in the late afternoon/evening communicates to the brain’s circadian clock that it is evening and time to begin the process of transitioning** to sleep that night**.
      * similar to sunrise but main time to accelerate  melatonin production
