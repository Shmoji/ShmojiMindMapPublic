  * **TODO soon**
    * [ ] Make so each API on backend is used on frontend in most MVP way

  * **TODO eventually**
    * [ ] Write code in updateXPExplanationCategoriesDB to prevent users from adding duplicate categories to an xpExplanation
    * [ ] Create global store for storing user data and if logged in. This is so don't need to ping backend every single time just to check if signed in and every single time user data is needed. May need to mess with expiration on both backend and frontend for session cookie. 
    * [ ] Somehow store all changes to xpExplanations, even if just adding categories to it. Currently, the user that added a category would not be recorded down. You could maybe make separate DB table to log stuff like this. Maybe could add it to xpExplanation table itself..but not sure yet..maybe combination of these 2 ideas
    * [ ] Add twitter login and gmail login. 
    * [ ] Allow users to come up with their own username on our platform

  * **TODO creative**
    * Script for whatever will be created
      * What are you feeling right now? In how much detail can you explain each feeling? What is the feeling exactly? Where is it originating from? Does it come from your thoughts? Is it just there for no reason? Feel free to pause and really think about this.
      * Right now I am sitting in my chair with my legs crossed and it feels comfortable. My back hurts all the time, but it hurts less in this position. I could go on and on about everything I'm feeling, even in a tiny little moment in time.
      * Every experience in life is interpreted by humans through feelings. Whether it is mental feelings, physical feelings, or both.
      * Then, why the heck are we not indexing all our feelings so we can compare.
      * What does it feel like to be depressed?
      * What does it feel like to have your heart broken?
      * What does it feel like to have a fungal sinus infection? What about a bacterial sinus infection? Does they feel different? Maybe not, but maybe they do. However, right now we are not directly tracking these feelings, so we cannot know.
