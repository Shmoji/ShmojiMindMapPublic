  * NOTE: im splitting this into many journals bc yuh. This one is old one and is kinda very general
  * tracking "why do i like creating?" or "why do i want to create?"
    * [[2024-11-13]]
      * it feels good
        * What feels good about it?
          * i can express parts of myself that feel "shiny". Why do i like this?
          * i can be seen by other people - but in specific ways that i prefer to be seen. those "shiny expressive parts"
          * the "flow" process when creating feels really nice
          * being proud of your creations afterwards (altho can feel poo poo about creations too)
      * i just have an intense feeling that i WANT TO create
        * i feel this is the minimal, but also main thing that drives me to keep trying to create no matter what - good or bad, whatever vs whatever
      * brainstorming questions
        * i wonder what i should focus on to unlock all my stuck creativity? and yes, im pretty confident my creativity is stuck. 
  * tracking when i created and what helped me do it

      * i went home for thanksgiving and something triggered creative storytelling energy in me. I created this short story: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/list of my stories#^P6VMYK-cS|[brain typing story](https://twitter.com/Shmojii/status/1728089446791143649)]]
      * my best guess of what caused this creational energy is being around loving and slow energy. No need to rush, can just be with people i love and create
    * [[2024-03-26]]
      * i read something that inspired a novel idea in me - also a creative idea. At first thought i needed to write short story on it. But then i tried something new even tho i dont know where idea came from. Kinda reminded me of that collab conspiracy theory page. I basically listed out an idea in form of a technology wiki page. [Here](https://x.com/Shmojii/status/1772798351412547879?s=20):
      * this felt almost perfect. like an authentic expression of what was trying to manifest. a short story wasnt trying to manifest, this was - and i know that.

  * tracking possible creative routes to try

      * today i posted this:
        * one big issue ive had over time is my mind spawns fictional thought-provoking stories all the time. And ive experimented with many methods to tell those stories

but none of the methods have resonated strongly yet

posting them on X is quickest, so it's best, but it feels like these stories need more than just text. There needs to be another creative aspect than just the generation of the thought-provoking part of the story
      * at first i was set on creating environments in unreal and making them into a picture for each panel of the story, but that wasnt resonating enough. I would have done that, but had another idea
      * i could use pics from creations i resonate with as panels. Imagine spartan getting shot to represent death or something like that. Spyro to represent a dragon. May not be the best to use another creation for my creation idk, but i really like this idea in ways.
      * EDIT: thought more about it and i feel using other creations for content may not work. Idk why i think that tho. I imagined all panels having forge mode panels and imagined random marvel scene panels and the vibe seemed wrong.
      * OO IDEA: what if i use stuff that is connected to my experience even tho other people dont know. Ive done that with so much of my other content and i love that even if other people dont know. For example, death related, could take pic of my hoodie emblem. And if i cant find anything, it will be a journey to discover it - AND maybe on that journey for some panels ill feel like creating something myself
    * [[2024-04-07]]
      * going back to last point, i made realization. I think i can do one or the other: 1) using pics/snapshots of things connected to my experience (like a statue at mall near me, emblem on hoodie) for panels in story OR 2) creating myself
      * idk maybe you can somehow combine those, but seems like 2 allows you to carry a scene/context like HausOfDecline does, but 1 doesnt really do that when grabbing from very different contexts
      * i could probably find way to do both, Like importing pic into 3d environment and making the scene flow enough to carry across panels and story
    * [[2024-04-08]]
      * fugg it, just to do something, im gonna make this one using things from environment and things that have meaning. So emblem on hoodie and Yu Yu Hakusho. Despite that using YuYu feels wrong bc then it introduces characters that wont continue into next panels. It's like adding "yous"/characters takes away from story unless they are meant for that story.
  * tracking thoughts related to finding art/content i like to create consistently
    * [[2024-05-27]]
      * im really feeling that dread of not wanting to code - even if it allows me to create my project. had the thought: i wonder if i could create art of the project instead of building it. like write a story and put emote as part of the book
