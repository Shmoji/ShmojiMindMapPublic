    * During stream or in social situations, i think my mind often defaults to change. It physically feels like i need to change. And it is bad feeling. MY voice, my behavior, my face, etc. If i can get past that and identify with the infinite, it goes muchhhh better. It helps to perform each action with love and recognize when each action is not coming from love. Especially when it is coming from fear.
