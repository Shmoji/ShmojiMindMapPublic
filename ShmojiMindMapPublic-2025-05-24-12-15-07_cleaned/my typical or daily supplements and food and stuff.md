  * tracking changes to regimen
    * [[2024-07-17]]
      * switching from around 217mg of magGlyc to around 334mg...hope i dont get squirty
      * so far no squirts. But the powder that comes out of pills is totally different than buying as powder. it seemed like pill powder and was nasty
      * i switched to microingredients pills bc powder seems discontinued...no idea why
    * [[2025-01-07]] spoon be chelating w MgCh, how much Mg to take, what is elemental Mg #[[fast memo]]
      * magCHLORIDE and HEAVY METALS: WOW, i just learned you shouldnt stir drink with magChloride in it with metal bc it will chelate the metal...which i think means ur straight up drinking heavy metals
      * no idea what chelate means aside from: can break heavy metal particles into yo drink
      * HOW MUCH MAG YOU SHOULD TAKE: 5-10mg elemental Mg per lb of body weight should be goal intake. GRIM: 400-800mg is often insufficient for essentially anyone....but thaz where i fall if using min of 5mg lol
      * WHAT IS ELEMENTAL MAG?: iz just the amount of mag. bc often there's other stuff like chloride or glycinate.
      * based on below, looks like i take total of 454mg Mg daily. Based on weight of 120, seems i should get that up to 600mg
      * if i just add additional scoop of MgCh, that will add 120mg, which gets very close to 600mg - will start this change today
    * [[2025-05-20]]
      * confused by last notes now. Bc this looks like how much MgCh i take: cup1: 240mg (2 scoops of 1/4tsp), cup2: 240mg = 480mg
      * ahh i see, i was counting total Mg with MgGlyc also in past note
      * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/my typical or daily supplements and food and stuff#^vQ8rdbioZ|2 pills of microingredients magGlyc - which is around 334mg]]
      * 2 scoops in 2 separate cups + 2 pills of MgGlyc = 814mg
  * NOTE: all these arent exactly supps but you get the point
  * take almost daily
    * 1/4 tsp magnesium chloride (once in morning with tea)
      * magnesium is active part in like hundreds of different body processes
      * i believe magnesium is what stopped my stones from forming (as long as i stay hydrated) - cant remember exactly how it works tho
      * 1/4 tsp of what i have is 120mg of Magnesium (i take PURE MagChloride hexahydrate crystal powder)
      * [[chloride]]
    * magnesium glycinate
      * 2 pills of microingredients magGlyc - which is around 334mg ^vQ8rdbioZ
      * [[glycine]]
      * retired
        * 1/4 tsp microingredients magnesium glycinate powder (once at night with tea)
          * GPT approximates 1/4 tsp of what i have is 217 mg magnesium (this may be wrong tho)
    * slightly less than 1/4 tsp of iodized salt (once in morning and once at night - both with tea) - get that iodine and sodium
      * iodine is apparently super important - idek
      * sodium = electrolytes = good for making sure water hydrates you and other stuff too...i guess
      * [[chloride]]
    * 1 tbsp of black seed oil
      * good for inflammation
      * amount per serving of stuff
        * serving = 1 tsp (4g)
