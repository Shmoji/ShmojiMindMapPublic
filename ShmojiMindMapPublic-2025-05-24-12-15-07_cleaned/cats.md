    * tracking thoughts on how to train and get cats to travel
      * [[2024-03-09]]
        * seems like traveling and using leash at young age is v good idea. That's what YTer did
        * bring blanket for cat to pee on in emergency
        * bring scooper and stuff to pick up turds just in case. Can also have disposable litter box
        * prob bring cat treats and even meal depending how long a trip
        * best to not feed before trip
        * in your car you can probably just let kitty cat roam free. anywhere else, prob best to keep harness on and try to keep cat in carrier
        * can i use cat backpack as carrier or no? quick search seems to say yes

      * [[2024-03-16]]
        * learned you can apply to cats through foster parent and not just the organization
        * learned it's better to not limit saying i NEED a cat that will walk with harness - i can use cat backpack
        * dont think i like getting at Pet store bc they have to stay in cages and better to see in less crazy caged environment
        * lady said good thing about older cats is that you already know their personality whereas all baby cats are crazy lol so cant predict personality

          * the closet in bathroom ^b72gYfSYI
            * this is good bc 1) in safe and away place 2) easy to clean up on hardwood floor if cat messy 3) puts main area in my room instead of outside my room
        * what is the healthiest food for cats?
          * most people say you just gotta try multiple until find one your cat likes lol

        * where will i put litter box?
          * im thinking near the toilet in bathroom
            * online says to keep their litter box away from their food, so hopefully that's far enough
