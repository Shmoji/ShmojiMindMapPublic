  * key points
    * is a very good acid-base buffer
    * acts as a buffer, helping to maintain a stable pH in various biological and chemical processes. Bicarbonate is commonly found in our body's blood as a part of the bicarbonate buffer system, which helps regulate the pH of the blood. It's a crucial aspect of maintaining acid-base balance.
    * significant component of the carbonic acid equilibrium system in water (blood is mostly water)
