      * Trying to fix gut issues, which is mainly bloating rn
        * honestly, this isn't necessary. my gut repair protocol works after time. I don't have pain or pressure in gut and chest anymore. bloating seems to be going away with time. it only came back bc covid. however, i will still experiment with what doctor recommended
        * she told me to take Megaspore (a probiotic supplement) once every other day for week. then once per day for a week. then twice per day for a week. You have to do it this way or doing too much quickly can actually cause gut issues
      * Trying to fix sinus/face/head issues

        * Could be caused by **fungus** in the nose and sinus. So, we are using Netty Pot sinus rinse with 3 drops of [[Methylene Blue]] twice daily.
          * I'm not seeing much of anything on Google about using MB in sinus rinse...but why?

        * Could be caused by [[MRSA]] (bacteria) in the nose, so we are trying a prescription nasal spray from Puramint. The spray is multiple **antibiotics**, but since it's not oral, it will not hurt gut.
          * Spray contains Bactroban (Mupirocin), Gentamicin, and Itraconazole
          * I called and doctor said since this is nasal spray, it gets into the blood stream much less, so kidney issues should not be an issue. Google said same thing
          * [[Mupirocin]]
            * PROs
              * Mupirocin nasal ointment is used to treat or prevent infections in the nose due to certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
              * Mupirocin is a commonly used antibiotic for decolonization of **MRSA** in carriers and for treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA
            * CONs
              * Maybe can be bad for people with kidney disease...but not super strong evidence for that. Seems may just be issue when used with wounds too.

          * [[Gentamicin]]
            * PROs
              * Gentamicin is an antibiotic used to treat several types of bacterial infections. This may include bone infections, endocarditis, pelvic inflammatory disease, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and sepsis among others.
              * Gentamicin nasal spray effectively eradicates antibiotics resistant bacteria in the sinus cavity.
            * CONs
              * DANGER: Gentamicin can harm your kidneys, and may also cause nerve damage or hearing loss, especially if you have kidney disease or use certain other medicines. Internet says kidney damage very common for it. Horrifying. Especially after what happened to me with covid.
          * [[Itraconazole]]
            * PROs
              * Itraconazole is used to treat a variety of fungal infections. It belongs to a class of drugs known as azole antifungals. It works by stopping the growth of fungi. This includes infections in any part of the body including the lungs, mouth or throat, toenails, or fingernails.
            * CONs
              * Side effects, which of course could be related to kidneys. And heart too
    * [[Log of health notes]]
      * Stopped using Prose shampoo about 2 showers ago. So far, have seen no symptoms change, so I assume not allergic to anything in it. Still, will continue for a month or so.
      * @9:45am on 8/26 with Abby for consult before getting Candida testing at https://www.regenesismd.com/. Cost is $150-250 every 20 minutes
  * [[MBTI type - social patterns]]
    * Apparently my type is INFJ-T
