          * Earth's continents are scattered across the planet today, but plate tectonics are constantly rearranging the surface of our world. The continents will merge 250 million years from now into a single supercontinent called "Pangea Ultima," surrounded by a planet-spanning ocean. Beyond a few temperate regions, most of this continent will become a vast desert, with temperatures reaching 40-50 Celsius. Researchers predict that only 8-16% of Earth's land will still be habitable for mammals.

      * #Kurzgesagt : #Australia, #[[New Zealand]], or #Argentina - due to where they are in Earth's hemisphere - there would be less impact from nuclear winter on them
