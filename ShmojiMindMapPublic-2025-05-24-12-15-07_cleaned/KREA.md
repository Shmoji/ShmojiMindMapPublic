    * KREA patterns https://www.krea.ai/fun/patterns
      * you can write out text and then embed that text into any image
      * in addition to the above you can embed basically any symbol into any image in a trippy cool way
      * these images can also be turned into videos like RunwayML 
    * KREA logos
      * you can do basically same as KREA patterns, except with a logo (is this just same tech under the hood and more of a difference from user perspective or?)
    * KREA real-time
      * Maybe using the same tool idk, but you can draw/create symbols and then it generates a similar ai-generated image right beside it
