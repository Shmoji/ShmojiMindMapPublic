  * what do i have control over personally?
    * my actions (which actions?)
    * My devices
      * Although, i cant control if they fail, but i can try.
  * is all desire for control based in [[fear]]? what's an example of desire for control that is not based in fear? when i put a fence up so my dog doesnt run in the road and get splattered - does that decision start from fear or from love?
