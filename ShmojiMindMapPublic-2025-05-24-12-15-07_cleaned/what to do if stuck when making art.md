      * had dream and instantly knew i wanted to make into art
      * started trying to make it into art in procreate, but feels like i just wasted my time and what i did didnt even resonate or feel soulful
      * idea i liked: make errthing less important gray scale
      * i think i need to start with more of an OUTLINE than focusing in on details of stuff - and not even worry about it being bad in any way
      * i KNOW almost exactly what i want to create...i can do dis!

      * going directly off last point - i need to focus on contrast. work on outline to make the contrast of my vision become more and more obvious. from blob/nothing to obvious/clear/vision

  * specifically for drawing art
    * just scribble and have fun and play. take brush and literally scribble ugly nonsense
    * write out all your expectations and then try to draw those expectations
    * try to follow instead of judging
    * if these dont resonate, watch the source of them: https://youtu.be/XIFQa3Dpqyk?si=-nTsdAuzRnrCK9tJ
