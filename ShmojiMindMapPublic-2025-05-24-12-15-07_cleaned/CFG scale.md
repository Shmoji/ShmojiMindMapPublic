  * what is it?
    * High CFG Scale: When set to a higher value, the model is more likely to produce outputs that are closely aligned with the prompt. This can be useful for tasks where accuracy and specific information retrieval are important.
    * Low CFG Scale: A lower CFG scale allows the model to be more creative and exploratory in its responses. This can lead to more diverse and unexpected outputs, which can be beneficial for creative tasks or when looking for a wide range of ideas.
