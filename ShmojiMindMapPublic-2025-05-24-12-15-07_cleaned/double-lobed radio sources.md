  * what are they?
    * They contain:
      * A central compact active galaxy
      * A pair of jets emanating from this galaxy
      * Lobes that produce synchrotron radiation
      * Hot spots in the lobes caused by the collision of the jets with the intergalactic medium
    * The scale of double-lobed radio sources can be enormous. Officially, the largest known, J1420−0545, is around 4.5 million parsecs across. Speculatively, the largest observed is 5.8 million parsecs across. To put that into perspective, our Local Galaxy Group that contains around two dozen galaxies is about 3 million parsecs across. (read more about the speculation on the European Southern Observatory’s website)…black holes are known to correlate with jets.
