  * tracking learning what is organic vs inorganic
    * [[2024-09-23]] what is organic vs inorganic first try, organism #memo
      * complex C-H/C-C bonded molecules (these bonds themselves dont necessarily store big energy, but lead to BIG energy storage and transfer - like in ATP - like in bonds between glucose in starch) EDIT: energy first stored in glucose-glucose bonds, but then transferred to individual glucose, which then transfers to ATP and electrons carriers (which eventually lead to ATP too) - then ATP usez da shiz for all kinds of stuff
      * meme: matter that allows big store/transfer of ENERGY, macromolecules/good at unitizing to form structures that do complex processes (even non-energy related processes, but maybe only possible bc big energy benefits of organic molecules? computers analogy below related to dis)
      * meme: organization (of autopoietic units that are made from the nonauto units). chemical/substance is non-autopoietic when smaller than cell. BUT those nonauto units lead to cell...the smallest organism...smallest thing that is indeed autopoietic (self-producing and self-maintaining). And there is certain class of the nonauto substances that lead to organisms that are autopoietic
      * Q: are organic molecules known as basis of life because together with abundant oxygen they can very efficiently transfer energy and do work?
        * YES. Store and transfer energy/change - which is fundamental for life processes.
        * NOT JUST 4 ENERGY: organic compounds are also highly diverse and can form complex structures like proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, which are essential for biological functions beyond just energy transfer. me: tbh, it seems they form complex units that allow MANY complex processes - which may just be work in the end, but it got so complex it's hard to tell it's all energy-transfer - just like with computers
        * Q: are all proteins organic molecules? A: YES
        * Common types of organic molecules include:
          * **Carbohydrates**, **Lipids**, **Proteins**, **Nucleic Acids**
        * NOTE: carbs are not only organic molecule for storing and transferring energy. Will memo elsewhere tho. carbs are main player in STORING energy tho
        * Q: would organic molecules still be basis of life without oxygen or do they have to be together?
          * Yes - even without oxygen - as seen by life like anaerobic bacteria and archaea. But with our history, it seems like oxygen was needed to get big life - who knows if that's actually requirement for big life or not tho
        * Q: so is an organism just a living thing made of organic molecules?
          * Yes. organism is generally defined as a living thing that consists of one or more cells and can carry out essential life processes such as growth, reproduction, metabolism, and response to stimuli.
          * Q: so are all cells made of organic molecules? A: yes - millions - billions in one single cell.
          * NOTE: there are no organisms smaller than a cell, but many that are just one cell. Although, some viruses are smaller than a cell, but typically they are not considered organisms because they cannot carry out metabolic processes on their own and require a host cell to replicate.

        * Q: is it possible to have a single cell that is not an organism?
          * Yes. Organisms are defined as living entities capable of independent functioning, growth, and reproduction. However, not all single cells meet this criterion.
          * examples:
            * 1.	Human or Animal Cells: Cells like skin cells, blood cells, or neurons from multicellular organisms cannot survive or reproduce on their own. They rely on being part of a larger system for their functions.
            * 2.	Cultured Cells: Cells that are grown in a lab (such as cancer cells in tissue cultures) can survive and even reproduce in controlled environments, but they are not considered independent organisms because they do not function independently in a natural ecosystem.
            * 3.	Egg or Sperm Cells: These gametes contain genetic material but are not capable of independent life or reproduction without combining with another gamete to form a new organism.
            * NOTE: some of Levins work blurs these lines but overall this still true
            * BUT obv there are single-celled organisms as discussed b4
