      * i think i can consume audio content pretty darn quick and still comprehend - at least in a satisfying way
      * i think i cannot read with eyes very quick. But sometimes i can for some reason 
      * mistake i always make when reading is converting visuals to inner hearing bc it feels like without doing that, i wont comprehend what i read
      * not sure yet how to improve. best guess is to read with heart and focus on no senses, but instead on imagination being invoked between all senses. But then if i try this or TRY anything, my focus is holding a trying object which then distracts me enough to not comprehend what im reading and i get pissed
