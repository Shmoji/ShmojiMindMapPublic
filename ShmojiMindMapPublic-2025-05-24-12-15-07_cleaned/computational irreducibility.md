  * what is it?
    * only way to compute the outcome of a system is to simulate its behavior step by step. In other words, there is no known shortcut or analytical method to directly determine the final result without performing the entire computational process.
      * so it's all about prediction? if computational process is simplified/reduced, then prediction of behavior/outcome not possible
    * these systems can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior that cannot be deduced from their initial conditions or governing rules alone
    * Wolfram argued that many natural and artificial systems, such as cellular automata, biological systems, and even some computational models, exhibit computational irreducibility
  * stupid
    * it cant be reduced bruh - if u reduce it - then your predictions of it then become wrong
  * related
    * [[computational boundedness]]
