  * tracking trying to find good sewer gas detector
    * [[2024-10-16]]
      * did lots of searching. i dont like how Forensics Detectors seems to have monopoly and their energy feeds into how good they are instead of merit of product. HOWEVER, i think they may be best. Some reviews said device didnt work, but most said they did - and some talked about how you can test the device in easy ways bc there's chemicals errwhere bb. Can do specific test for H2S using x, specific test for CH4 using x, etc
  * how TOs
    * how to test detector works to detect hydrogen sulphide?
      * apparently when boiling an egg, a very small amount is released - especially if OVERBOILED. GPT seems uncertain if gas leak detector would detect it or not
    * how to test detector works to detect methane?
      * bleh all long experiments. BUT maybe you could just test with your own poop or farts lol (GPT seems uncertain this would work)
    * how to test detector works to detect ammonia?
      * **Source**: The easiest way to obtain ammonia is from **household cleaning products** that contain ammonia (such as glass cleaners or all-purpose cleaners).
      * **Method**: To test the detector, you can pour a small amount of the cleaner into a container and allow it to evaporate near the detector. Ammonia will be released into the air as the liquid evaporates.
      * **Safety**: Be sure to work in a well-ventilated area and avoid prolonged exposure to the fumes, as ammonia can be irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat.
      * **Immediate detection**: If youâ€™re testing an ammonia detector, you should start detecting ammonia within a minute or so after exposing the cleaner to air, since ammonia gas is highly volatile.
      * **Complete evaporation**: The time it takes for the entire cleaner (including water) to evaporate depends on how much liquid you have, but the ammonia itself will have mostly evaporated long before the water finishes evaporating.
  * questions
    * what are the main toxic sewer gases?
      * Hydrogen Sulphide (H2S) and Methane (CH4) are the most common sewer gases. They are given off from waste material as it begins to decompose. These can cause both toxic and flammable hazards.
      * Other sewer gases that can possible be encountered include CO, Ammonia, Sulphur Dioxide and Nitrogen oxide, although these are less common.
