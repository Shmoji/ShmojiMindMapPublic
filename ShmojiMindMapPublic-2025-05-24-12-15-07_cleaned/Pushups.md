  * tracking trying to learn how to do pushups with good posture
    * [[2024-09-05]] learning basics of good pushup posture #memo
      * used this video today to learn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9fsqKE5XHo&list=WL&index=5&t=26s
      * points he said that stuck with me:
        * your shoulders should be right above wrists. he said wrist angle to your hands will be a lil acute than 90 degrees naturally
        * your forearms should stay perpendicular to ground and not even really move (he said stay vertical)
        * activate your core, your glutes (cheeks), and your thighs CONSCIOUSLY to maintain good posture. your chest and triceps will be activated by default
      * i noticed it's hard to keep my forearms perfectly perpendicular - they want to angle back back towards my butt a bit
      * i noticed i by default tend to stick my butt up in air - i thought it was the opposite until recording! fix for this from perplexity that i think helps: bring belly button in towards spine, but keep hips in place
      * i noticed i had to slightly widen my arms a bit bc it kinda hurt otherwise
      * i wrote about the hunch below - basically try to keep shoulders back and down or it causes many issues
      * today i just practiced a bit, but defs had no weird pain from bad posture - even in lower back - hopefully this stuff sticks and keeps working
      * next time i will do full workout like this and hopefully after intense one, no lower back pain or shoulder pain from bad posture

      * i noticed this: "when in pushup plank position, i feel lots of the activation in back part of shoulder on both sides. kind of above arm pits on back but also on shoulder. why?"
      * perplexity: When you perform a pushup plank, your body relies on these muscles to stabilize the shoulder girdle, preventing the collapse of the upper back and maintaining a straight line from your head to your heels. If you feel a lot of activation in this region, it could be due to the need for improved scapular stability or muscle engagement to maintain proper form
      * additionally, activating recommended parts above is essential to prevent excessive strain on your shoulders and back, which can lead to discomfort or pain. Ensuring that your shoulder blades are spread wide and not collapsing towards the spine can also help in distributing the workload more evenly across your upper body
      * so what i got out:
        * activate yo shit
        * spread arms a bit wider
        * finally study scapular pushups and start doing them
      * tried full workout today, but could barely do any pushups with correct posture. part of me feels like this will never improve and im doing something wrong that i wont be able to figure out. uncertain if i even worked out my chest, guess ill see
    * [[2024-09-16]]
      * still hard for me to even do a few pushups
      * i noticed my right shoulder pops if i keep good posture. Specifically keeping forearm perpendicular to ground. if dont keep good posture, then no pop happens. Pop doesn't hurt tho. Saw a video saying stretching may help stop popping
    * [[2024-11-12]]
      * well i can do a good number of pushups with pretty good posture now
      * but ive noticed my chest is never getting sore and spot i mentioned in previous note that is basically top-back shoulders is what gets sore. Not sure why
      * im gonna test putting something under my chest so dont have to go all way to floor - maybe that will help me debug what's going wrong
  * Common mistakes when doing pushups
