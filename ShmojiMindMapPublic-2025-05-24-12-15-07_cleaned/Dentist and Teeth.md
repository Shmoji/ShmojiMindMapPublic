  * Deep Cleaning, aka Root Planing and Scaling, aka deep gum cleaning
    * Floss and toothbrush can clean mouth to about 3mm. If gums go further than that, then you have gum disease, especially if there is gum inflammation and bleeding. The only way to clean gums > 3mm is by getting deep cleaning where they clean the tartar and plagues deep under. 
    * This can be done traditionally or with lasers. The laser treatment is much better in terms of pain, swelling, accuracy, cost, and everything
    * Laser deep cleaning = LANAP. Non-laser = SRP (scaling and root planing)
    * Seems like RIGHT NOW, LANAP is for more serious gum disease.
    * My interpretation is that LANAP does everything that SRP does, except better.
    * Some notes:
      * Traditional methods of cutting the gum will cause a person’s gum tissue to shrink. The LANAP procedure does not cut a person’s gums. This means their gum tissue will remain intact.
      * A small laser fiber will be placed between the tooth and gum. The laser fiber will have the thickness of three human hairs. It will make it possible to clear the gum disease and infection without a person’s gums being cut. During the procedure, the tooth root is cleaned as plaque and tartar are carefully removed. The laser is placed on a different setting. It will then be used to create a firm and stable blood clot so the pocket can be sealed.
      * **NEEDLES**: During each session, half of a person’s mouth is treated. The LANAP treatment involves **no anesthetic** and individuals can drive themselves to work or home after the procedure.
      * **LANAP pricing and insurance**: The price of LANAP treatment is determined on the amount of work a patient needs to be done. An experienced dentist will not assign a price for treatment until they have been able to carefully examine the patient. In some cases, LANAP treatment is often more cost-effective than traditional surgery. This is because it needs fewer visits to a dentist and less medication. Most healthcare policies will cover LANAP treatment. It is recommended individuals considering LANAP treatment first discuss it with their insurance provider. It’s important to know how their policy will cover the procedure.
  * Teeth Brushing
    * Do not brush right after eating food. Reasons: 1) Because enamel is soft and can be damaged more. 2) Food can be pushed into gums.
    * Better to brush after waking up and at night. This is because bacteria of mouth has a party while you sleep for 8 hours.
