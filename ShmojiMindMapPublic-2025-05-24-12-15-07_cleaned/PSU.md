  * what is a PSU (power supply unit) #memo ^yuLAeN7fh
    * basically same thing as step down transformers on electricity poles...but more! tldr: it stepping down voltage
    * NOTE: PSU actually has a step down transformer inside
    * What a PSU Does:
      * **Converts Power**: converts AC from outlet to DC
      * **Distributes Power**: The PSU then distributes this converted power to various components in the computer, supplying each with the correct voltage (e.g., 12V, 5V, 3.3V)
        * Q: does there need to be a separate transformer for each voltage conversion for each component? A: NO. Just one that i think happens during AC to DC conversion
      * **Regulates Power**: The PSU ensures that the power it provides is stable and clean, filtering out any noise and protecting against power surges, which could otherwise damage the components.
    * What a PSU is Not:
      * **Not a Power Generator**: The PSU does not generate its own power (that would require alternating mfield to induce current or turbine/renewable-source lol). It relies on the power supplied by an external source, such as the electrical grid. It merely converts and regulates this power.
      * **Not a Battery**: Unlike a battery, which stores chemical energy and converts it to electrical energy, the PSU does not store energy. A battery can provide power independently, while the PSU must be connected to an external power source to function.
