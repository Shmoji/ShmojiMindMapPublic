  * current things i have high hopes for with experimenting
    * ITRACONAZOLE: so this one is REALLY risky for liver and heart and more, so scared to take, BUT i tried nystatin and it focuses on Candida and did nothing for me. Gliotoxin levels show i may be dealing with Aspergillus, which would require itraconazole (which targets Aspergillus and much broader range, including candida).
    * retired
      * MYCOPUL: hoping it will get me feeling better and better. but idk, feel like im still not getting much better and im almost 2 months in. Havent had a real good day in about a week
  * things to track, but not necessarily experiments
    * urinary oxalate levels
      * fungi colonization can often produce oxalates. So if they're high, need to figure out how to get rid of fungi. I tried nystatin and no luck, so may try itraconazole too
  * experiments ACTIVELY in progress


  * if completely out of options, do these. Not high priority
    * [ ] experiment with SBI Protect
    * [ ] get neurozoomer test
      * So it's a test that shows antibodies to your own brain. Basically your body attacking itself. Cuz the immune system has gone haywire and out of control
    * [ ] Call and setup colonoscopy and endoscopy (i want someone with me)
  * sinus testing
    * [ ] Lactobacillus sakei nasal probiotic (R talked about in 1st plan and 2nd plan)
      * from 2nd plan: Use the probiotic [[Lactobacillus sakei]] in your nose to help treat and prevent sinus infections. L. sakei is a probiotic used to make kimchi and has been shown to reduce sinus infections and may be useful to eradicate unhealthy bacteria such as MARCoNS by restoring a healthy nasal microbiome. You can either use kimchi juice (snort it into each nostril twice a day) or get the probiotic as a powder.

      * [ ] TGF beta 1 (inflammatory marker) - if high, indicative of CIRS
      * [ ] MMP9 - if high, indicative of CIRS
      * [ ] C4a - if high, indicative of CIRS
        * if you get spike of C4a after it went down, this means a new exposure happened
      * [ ] MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone) (apparently this causes all symptoms) - if low, indicative of CIRS
      * [ ] ADH (if low, u always thirsty and will PP alot and nothing rebalances ur minerals) - so if low, indicative of CIRS

    * based on Rapaport
      * [ ] basically do the 2 pee pee (or maybe just 1) tests (which ive done) and then do same ones 2-4 months later after mycopul treatment
        * if gliotoxin is elevated, need antifungals. I already tried nystatin, so she was saying try itraconazole (100 mg twice a day). Get a GoodRx coupon for best pricing. For how to order, see Rapa plan 2
      * [ ] Stay on Saccharomyces boulardii until the Gliotoxin is cleared
        * why?
          * from Rapa: Sacch b is a probiotic fungus that is a good competitor for yeast and fungal colonization of the GI tract and vaginal tract. Its cell wall can also help to biotransform mycotoxins and can be a part of a mycotoxin removal program.
      * [ ] Try DNAConnexions if running out of options - it tests some things ive already tested, except slightly different i think. It tests for infections
        * details of this test in plan 2 from rapa

    * if you decide to test dad's house for mold:
      * do qPCR Swiffer Home Test (ERMI)
      * Can also do HERTSMI test
      * Can also do Actino Home Test, but more optional
      * After test, maybe get professional to check if needed

  * Go see this doctor that never seen before
    * [ ] See infectious disease DR. I have 1 year referral. Call 9849747198 to setup appointment (i asked if this is where to see Dr Perfect and they said no, this is easttown)
    * [ ] Need to see rheumatologist. Before, do research to predict what meeting will be like and what they'll even do for someone with rare condition

        * notes

          * Different types of braces
            * Anecdote on reddit: metal braces because they are not likely to stain and are less breakable than ceramic braces
            * Ceramic braces
              * Anecdote: less visible to eye, but more heavy ang big. Lot of people complaining about how big ceramic is. Seems i need to ask if Ceramic is more big and decide my decision off that.
              * Seems easier to break than metal. Double check this tho
            * Traditional vs Damon
              * Many people say Damon is less painful.
            * Self-ligating braces
              * Unlike traditional metal or ceramic braces, self-ligating braces do not require rubber ties to hold the wire in place. Instead, they use doors or clips.
              * Rest of pros and cons here: https://www.kshvid.com/types-of-braces/
          * Notes on braces
            * Elastic bands
              * Elastic bands, also called ligatures, are small rubber bands that are used to hold the archwire in place on the brackets of traditional metal or ceramic braces. The bands are stretched over the brackets and help to apply gentle pressure to the teeth, which helps to move them into the correct position. Elastic bands come in a variety of colors and can be changed at each orthodontic appointment to create a fun and personalized look. In contrast, self-ligating braces do not require elastic bands as they use a special clip to hold the archwire in place.
          * Ceramic/porcelain braces are more healthy than metal probably. Also harder to see. Cost $20 more per month tho.
          * invisalign vs braces: Dr Wells recommended braces because invisalign would not do very good job and lot of pressure on me to be responsible. After googling, braces seems to be the move
          * IMPLANT: Will get implant after braces done. Implant is healthier than none and healthier than bridge.
        * how long: will take 2 years to fix
        * costs without insurance:
          * Paying in full gives 4% discount
          * Diagnostic records and consultation (1st meeting): $395

    * [ ] glutathione
      * description from Rapaport
        * Glutathione is a master antioxidant. Individuals with mold and other biotoxin exposure may have reduction in glutathione production and supplementing can improve immunity and energy. The best form of glutathione is as a lipospheric or liposomal product rather than a reduced form. As a lipospheric form, it bypasses the liver and enters into the body and the cell, while the reduced form is broken down by the liver. If you feel better when you're on glutathione, you can stay on it.
        * Recommended brands are:
        * a. Researched Nutritionals (from Haven): Trifortify Watermelon or Orange: this is a liquid (thick consistency); take 1 teaspoon twice a day for 3 days. Comes in a tube or in individual packets. Most people prefer the Watermelon flavor.
        * b. Pure Encapsulations liposomal glutathione capsules: take 2 twice a day.

              * 1 daily away from Mycopul
              * Dosing may depend on what kind of trace mineral, but either way, still needs to be away from Mycopul
            * Why take?
              * To get replenish minerals that binders remove while also removing toxins
          * Take antifungal (such as Nystatin)
            * how to take?
              * I tend to use an anti-fungal prescription (such as Nystatin) twice a day (maybe needs to be separate from probiotic)
              * Nystatin: 1 with breakfast and 1 with dinner
            * Why take?
              * Due to me having indications of fungal overgrowth

            * how long to take?

          * Take certain probiotics (Saccharomyces boulardii recommended before tests, but maybe there is better now we have data?)
            * how to take?
              * Regular dosing: Take one twice a day.
            * Why take?
              * I think it helps with fungal overgrowth AND excessive bacteria?
          * Take something to treat Staph Aureus (but what? and is it needed or are my levels natural?)
        * try 2 organizing this
          * schedule
            * 8am - take 1 Probiotic (Saccharomyces boulardii - RestorFlora by Microbome Labs) - with FOOD

                * As long as taking Mycopul, then keep taking this. Start and stop date will be same as Mycopul
              * Decided to take this instead of TraceMinerals bc this has all same stuff, EXCEPT Silica and Iodine. Silica is apparently in rice, so good there. I can consume iodine salt no prob.
            * 11am - take 1 Nystatin
              * how long to take this for and what dates will i start and stop?
                * take for 10-14 days

                * Sources online
                  * 6 month minimum. 3 months. Take week off and re-revaluate and 3 more months. After 6-9-month protocol, pulse back to one week of every month to help keep the body clear and immune system engaged after treatment protocol ends https://education.fxmed.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/MycoPul-Training-Fxmed.pdf

            * 5-11pm - take hot bath
          * issues to watch for
            * ultraNutrient and AminoReplete both give Vitamin B6 - too much can be bad. Can cause nerve damage and photosensitivity. Nerve damage can lead to loss of control of muscles and body, so watch out for all of this. If bad happens, just switch to TraceMinerals.
            * Dont take MagChloride or youll prob be shittin since UltraNutrient gives same amount as my morning tea amount. 

      * QUESTIONS
        * QUESTIONS for DR
          * What are we treating?
            * my guess:
              * Staph Aureus in nose
              * Fungal overgrowth
              * Mycotoxins from mold exposure
              * Maybe excessive gut bacteria?
            * Are we treating Staph Aureus in nose?
            * Are we treating fungal overgrowth? If so, what what fungus and how do you know it's that one?
            * Are we treating excessive gut bacteria like clostridia? (seems maybe clostridia is natural?)
          * What to take for treatment?
            * do you recommend mycopul for me because we dont know a specific binder that will work for me?
            * How much of Mycopul do you recommend? (i am down for heavy die-off if it fixes my issues)
            * Should i take antifungal? And should i take it at same time as binders?
            * Does antifungal need to be taken separate from probiotic?
            * When taking binders, should i also take hot baths?
            * Should i take aloe vera for mycotoxins?

          * Maybe pointless questions
            * Why does it look like i have multiple issues: like mold and yeast overgrowth? Is that possible?
            * Is mold the issue? Or is it different type of fungus? How can you know?

          * If none of the treatments work, do you have any guesses for what i should try next? 
        * QUESTIONS about binders
          * what are binders?
            * Toxin or detox binders are specific compounds that bind toxins and remove them via the digestive tract so they’re not reabsorbed into the body.
            * Taken orally in pill, powder, gel, or tincture form, binders are a crucial piece to many treatment protocols, whether they include removing environmental toxins, reducing toxin exposure, or treating infections.
            * Different binders can attract different toxins, so knowing which one to use can make or break a protocol. ^mW-UWW8Hk
            * You can use binders to help bind and excrete toxins from various different issues, obv including mycotoxins from mold.
          * How Binders Work
            * Your liver is your main detox organ and can remove toxic chemicals on it’s own. It does this by creating bile, a digestive fluid that flows from the liver through the intestines to help break down fats for digestion and absorption.
            * Since many toxins are fat-soluble, they enter the bile. And in a perfect world, toxins would move with the bile through the intestines and out of the body through the stool. However, your gut lining is made of delicate tissues with veins and nerves that can pick up these toxins and recirculate them.
            * This is where binders come in. Binders attach to toxic metals, chemicals, biotoxins, and more to shuttle them safely out of the digestive tract without the risk of reabsorption and recirculation. Binders also reduce stress on other elimination and detox organs and help prevent herxheimer (inflammatory) reactions and uncomfortable detox symptoms.
          * why use Mycopul (my DR recommended) over other binders
            * it seems it employs multiple targeted binders to remove mycotoxins (toxins produced by mold), from the GI tract.
              * What is included in Mycopul:
                * Included in MycoPul are six targeted binders including G-Pur Zeolite Clinoptilolite, a patented, highly purified, and natural form of zeolite that uses a proprietary purification process to remove contaminants and enable it to bind to more toxins. MycoPul also contains superior humic acid sourced from a particular peat bog in Europe known to produce the purest and most potent humic substance available. This bog produces material with an average humic acid concentration of 70%, compared to most other sources which average around only 30% humic acid. Other binders include Activated charcoal, Microchitosan and Silica. Please note that the Microchitosan is sourced for shellfish (snow crab) and the Silica is from bamboo extract. Avoid this product if you have any allergies or known reactions to any of these ingredients.
            * Intended to bind and remove the most prevalent mycotoxins.
            * ANECDOTES from interwebz
              * cholestyerum is much more powerful binder. Mycopul is a gentle building block.
          * what is light treatment vs heavy treatment (i have a feeling i may need the heavy)
            * Recommended by my doctor: ^FSH_kNEJW
              * Mycopul: 1 daily at NIGHT, away from meals, meds and supplements
              * Trace Minerals: 1 daily away from Mycopul
              * Regular dosing: One capsule daily on an empty stomach, taken 1 hour before and/or 2 hours after eating (2 is better). Increase fluid intake when taking MycoPul to avoid constipation.
              * Sensitive Patients dosing: Open one capsule and stir well to dissolve in water. Depending on your sensitivity, start with 1/4 of the cup or as little as 1/4 teaspoon of the water if you are very sensitive. Increase as tolerated; take one daily.
          * can you take binders multiple times? will you become resistant?
            * You will not become resistant, but prob would prefer to only take binders one time and have issues resolve, rather than mycotoxins coming back lol
        * What are trace minerals? Are they also binders?
          * They are not binders. BUT binders often deplete good minerals, so trace minerals stop that depletion. So, important to take trace minerals with binders (although at separate times is important)
      * When considering treatment options
        * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/Health Experimenting#^mW-UWW8Hk|Different binders can attract different toxins, so knowing which one to use can make or break a protocol.]]

        * It did indeed relieve pain for a few minutes. So maybe it is TMD and the heat gives slight muscle relief for a second.
    * [x] One day when feeling colder than usual - trying eating some iodized salt and see results. May need to wait until next day for results.
      * Results
        * Hard to track this, but dont think it works so far. Gonna keep testing this.
    * [x] Need to see Biological Dentist - carl mcmillan is best/ralf mensa, michael fleming
      * Ask him about bump on gums
      * Results

    * [x] Need to see Bob Taylor ENT with experience with mold/marcons. If he says not ENT issue, then prob not
      * Online said can confirm sinus infection with swab of snot and send to lab

      * Waiting to do colonoscopy and endoscopy for stable job
    * [x] NEED to get stool test for EVERYTHING possible. I realized this after reading this "I did stool testing and found four infections—two bacteria, a yeast, and a fungus—all slowly decimating Maria’s white blood cells." from https://www.drcarri.com/do-you-have-any-of-these-signs-of-hidden-infections/
      * Results
        * I did "GI Effects® Comprehensive Profile - 1 day". Nothing really stuck out in it. There goes that money yay.
    * [x] One day when feeling soreness, tiredness, weakness - trying eating some iodized salt and see results. May need to wait until next day for results.

    * [x] Applying to UDN at Duke
      * Results
        * They did not accept me because apparently they would not be able to solve my case

    * [x] Get all thyroid tests including antithyroid antibody test
      * What i learned
        * I dont seem to have thyroid issues. Primary DR i didnt like did basic thyroid tests i think and they fine. Dr Taylor did complex tests and they seem fine. I think he did the antithyroid antibody test. He tested Thyroglobulin Antibody, Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab, and Triiodothyronine (T3), Free and they're all good. Those results can be found in email right now under S Taylor. May be moved to LabCorp eventually.
        * This maybe gets rid of Hashimotos or Graves disease
    * [x] Ask Dr Stone to check for mitochondrial disorder. If tests look alarming for this, then go to (Dwight Koerbl at Duke, geneticist) 
      * What i learned
        * Metabolomix gave a lot of data on mitochondrial stuff and it doesn't really indicate mitochondrial disorder. But if Candida and mold ends up not being issue, i think i should go down this route
    * [x] Need to do hertsmi test on home with envirobiomics to check for mold issues
      * I never did this because i have these issues anywhere i go, i dont think it's a mold issue in a current home
    * [x] Tried comprehensive pee test called Metabolomix+ to see if any useful data comes from it
      * What i learned
        * It measured 4 broad categories. Only 1 showed clear issues. The 4 categories are: Oxidative Stress, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Toxic Exposure, Methylation Imbalance. My only bad one is Oxidative Stress. But again, this is broad, can still have issues with very individual biomarkers in a good category, which can be important info to solving this.
