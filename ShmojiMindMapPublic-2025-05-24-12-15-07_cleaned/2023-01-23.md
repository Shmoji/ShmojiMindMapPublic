    * I seem to flourish when someone sees the good in me when i cannot and i recognize them seeing that in me. For example, Marty. I told him how i dont remember things unless valuable to me and that screws me in interviews.

    * Thinking about it and i become less confident that alignment of my teeth are my core issue. I say this because this morning my jaw and throat felt fine. But this afternoon they hurt about 6/10. All symptoms happened at same time too. Upper nose pain, muscles weakness all over, jaw/throat pain, burning skin on head and upper nose. But on the other hand, maybe the long-term history view makes sense. I didn't have jaw/throat pain until around 2018. This was around when i got wisdom teeth removed which is huge change for jaw.
    * I just tried opening mouth while jaw was hurting because that should be more relaxed position and pain pretty quickly got lil better. Not sure if because jaw is not clenching as much or because getting good oxygen from mouth breathing. Need to experiment more with this
