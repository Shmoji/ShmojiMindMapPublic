  * NOTE 1: this is all things to track. Goal is to update each of these every x amount of time OR only when i feel novel info has appeared that requires updating them (more likely). Maybe will make list to just check every day or every month just because. So novelty not needed. Novelty not needed for being grateful. Maybe make categories if that feels right too
  * NOTE 2: if i just dont track something, that either means: 1) there was no issue to track 2) i forgot lol
    * like think about it, im not really gonna track something unless: 1) the issue is significant 2) im super interested/excited about the thing
