  * whats best format to export on roam?
    * AI: 
      * The best format to export from Roam depends on your specific needs and the tools you plan to use for further processing or sharing. Here are some common export formats and their considerations:
        * Markdown: Exporting to Markdown format allows for easy readability and compatibility with various note-taking apps and text editors. Markdown files are plain text files with simple formatting syntax. This format is suitable if you want to continue working with your notes in a lightweight and portable format[1](https://thinkstack.club/manually-export-to-another-roam-graph/)[6](https://nesslabs.com/roam-to-obsidian).
        * JSON: Roam's JSON export format provides a structured representation of your data, including page hierarchy and attributes. JSON files are machine-readable and can be used for data analysis or custom processing. This format is useful if you want to programmatically manipulate or analyze your Roam data[2](https://davidbieber.com/snippets/2020-04-25-roam-json-export/).
        * EDN: The EDN (Extensible Data Notation) format is the only format that exports the complete content of a Roam graph. It includes all the metadata and relationships between pages. However, using the EDN format will overwrite all existing data if you import it into another Roam graph. It is recommended to use this format only when exporting a whole Roam graph to a new or replacement graph[1](https://thinkstack.club/manually-export-to-another-roam-graph/).
        * HTML: Roam42 has a web view feature that allows you to export a Roam page as a plain HTML web page. This format can be useful if you want to share or print a specific page from Roam
