  * what is it?
    * GPT4:
      * ChromeDriver is essentially a server for the Chrome browser that understands WebDriver protocol commands. When it receives these commands from Selenium, ChromeDriver does not translate them (selenium already did); instead, it directly communicates these commands to the Chrome browser. ChromeDriver's job is to interact with Chrome in a way that makes the browser perform the actions specified by your Selenium script.

      * GPT4:
        * ChromeDriver and Selenium are closely related but serve different roles in the context of automating web browsers. Look at der definitions to understand
        * Regarding using ChromeDriver without Selenium, it's theoretically possible but not practical for most use cases. ChromeDriver is designed to accept commands in the WebDriver protocol, which is what Selenium uses. While you could technically send these commands directly to ChromeDriver without using the Selenium library, it would require a thorough understanding of the WebDriver protocol and a lot of manual work to replicate what Selenium does out of the box.
        * In summary, while you can use ChromeDriver without Selenium, it is not commonly done because Selenium provides a convenient and high-level API to interact with ChromeDriver and, by extension, the Chrome browser.
