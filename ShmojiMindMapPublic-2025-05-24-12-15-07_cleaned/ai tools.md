      * TIME: 10-30 minutes for around 1 minute video, even tho it says it should be much faster (maybe bc free and other people also using?)
        * I just learned this: "you can duplicate the space to avoid the long queues". You can do that publicly or private. You can also clone the repo and use locally.
      * TRY 2: 10-30 minutes for a 1 and half hour video. AMAZING
      * if it instantly errors out, just keep spam clicking it and it eventually works lol. Otherwise find duplicate space by searching same name

          * With needed hardware (which i dont have) can generate about 5 second videos. Which is not even worth it to me
        * using in huggingface space
          * takes 2-10 minutes and generates 2 second video. Kinda cool
        * using in collab
          * same as huggingface space, but took way longer. like 30 minutes
          * also have to trust collab creator with your data. bit of a risk
