      * i had to stop eating goat cheese bc it seemed to make me bloated and cause mucus down throat and sinus pain. Maybe can go back one day if ever fix sinusitis and bloating
      * im thinking about stopping chocolate too :( bc i took break and my mucus down throat went down, but then i ate some again and quickly got mucus down throat again. Also, i just learned dark chocolate is bad for having cadmium and lead. So im gonna find healthiest brand and only eat like once or twice per week
      * popcorn still seems good
      * apples are still good
      * hummus and some other dippee is good
      * bananas are good
  * BEST: goat cheese (Spring Koe Gouda is fav) 
  * Hummus and carrots/chips/celery/cucumbers. I like hummus over guacamole, bc guac goes bad in like 2 days
  * Rice cakes with peanut butter
  * Popcorn
  * Salted pumpkin kernels
  * Healthy chocolate
    * From Whole Foods, i got container of pieces of dark chocolate, no added sugar. From local seller section. It was very good and long lasting.
  * Fruits
    * Apples
    * Bananas
  * UNHEALTHY:
    * Walmart's $0.99 Spicy Guacamole Tortilla Chips
  * My taste and texture preferences
    * For some reason, i love crunchy stuff that i can chew for long periods of time
