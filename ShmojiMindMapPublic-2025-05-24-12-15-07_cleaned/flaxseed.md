  * things to consider to make sure you get healthiest option
    * is it grounded or not?
      * U WANT GROUNDED: it's important to consume ground flaxseed meal rather than whole flaxseeds, as the whole seeds can pass through the digestive system undigested, limiting the absorption of their nutrients. Grinding the flaxseeds makes it easier for the body to access the beneficial components.
      * confusing terms: "grounded" and "whole ground" is same thing. But just "whole" is the less healthy thing to avoid
    * expiration
      * PUT IN FRIDGE IN CONTAINER: While ground flaxseed meal is generally considered a healthy choice, it's important to note that the nutrient content can degrade over time due to exposure to light, heat, and oxygen. To preserve its nutritional value, it's recommended to store flaxseed meal in an airtight container in the refrigerator and consume it within a few months.
      * how to know when expired?
        * Smell: One of the first indicators of spoilage is a rancid or off smell. If the flaxseed meal has a strong, unpleasant odor, it's likely no longer good for consumption.
        * Taste: If you notice an unusual or bitter taste in the flaxseed meal, it could be an indication that it has gone bad.
        * Appearance: Visually inspect the flaxseed meal for any signs of mold, discoloration, or clumping. If you see any of these signs, it's best to discard it.
        * Texture: Flaxseed meal should have a dry, powdery texture. If it feels moist or has a sticky consistency, it may have absorbed moisture and could be spoiled.
        * It's also important to note the expiration date or "best by" date printed on the packaging. While this date can give you a general guideline, it's always a good idea to use your senses to assess the quality of the flaxseed meal.
