  * what is it?
    * ai chat and different bots created by Quora team and by community
  * their monetization structure
    * if a bot causes a user to subscribe to Poe (measured a few ways), Poe will share a cut of the revenue the user pays
    * you can set a per-message fee for your bot and Poe will pay that on every message.
      * Im not totally sure i understand # 2 bc how can Poe afford that
