  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * This morning had little splotches of blood in poop. Why is this? Does this mean some sort of stomach issue?
    * Met with family doctor at UNC Family Medicine of Panther Creek. Dr Sarah Gardwood. I think she can be trusted, but didn't click with her. Had the opposite of click. She started pushing to try SSRIs. I didn't vibe. She did want to get bloodwork which is good, but i didnt prepare mentally so declined. Think she wanted to get cholesterol info. She also pushed me to get tetanus vaccine and was skeptical when i declined because i wanted to research how it affects people with autoimmune disease. Not a vibe.
    * Haven't had kidney pain, but I seem to have kidney pressure. Mainly on left side today
  * [[TODO eventually - one day - dreams]]

  * [[Medical procedures]] updated. Specifically [[Colonoscopy and Endoscopy]]
