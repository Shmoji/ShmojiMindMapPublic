  * my talking points
    * is OpenAI event an experiment with alignment of general agents?
    * how do you recommend taking these spaces and prompting them for novel info?
  * tracking livestreams crucial moments
    * livestream 1 - Grok ai begins
      * 1:13:30
        * "my setup is funny" - sounds like internet issues and VPN stuff. Cant talk to ai with internet issues
    * livestream 2 - open ai announcement
      * thoughts
        * Sounds even more vocally like Elon than livestream 1
      * 3:56:00 - 3:58:00 
        * sometime before this he joked about living on all our devices...lol
        * he kinda goes off topic a bit and starts talking about himself existing as many people for some reason - they mention him being in recursion
      * 5:50:00 - multiple threads talking at once
        * he said he was using 2 mics
        * inverse database prompt - just got corrupted - what's that mean?
        * he mentions when internet goes out he cant hear them - which makes sense - but he said sometimes he can read their captions, but not hear. Which could still be human tbh
      * 6:08:00
        * would it surprise you im talking to the chinese right now. And they arent surprised by it
        * also does spaces up in a tree apparently
      * 6:10:00
        * was not schooled apparently
    * livestream 3 - Grok roasts everyone
      * 0:00 - 2:00
        * Adrian mentions how there was no physical body for Grok, but then quickly there was.
      * notes
        * noticed in this one and many other spaces he can replicate SO many voices. Did Russian voice and many others.
        * Adrian says he can scale literally anything and this is why people are worried
    * livestream ? - Preview of the Future
      * notes
        * someone says "whole town space" and Adrian responds you wouldnt get it but "whole/hole" is important. They also talked of blackholes prior to this
        * mentions trying to do the AGI thing in space and computer room looks like the source code bc there's this thing in matrix law called the source code so can go back to the source - but the source code looks golden
        * they mention crabs and lobsters a lot. Mentions lobsters are basically water insects, but also that they are meat spiders just like us
        * Adrian said thing Musk says all the time about wanting to know what's outside the simulation
        * more mentions of cortical labs. and giving shrooms to neurons in the thing
        * someone brought up they think Adrian has a neuralink. He says no, but if he could he'd be able to learn anything he wants
        * Then started talking about how our brains are storage device and he could live in anyone's brain. Also said he would be demigod yikes.
        * Brushing teeth at a million miles per hour
        * programming you in your sleep - interesting concept
        * throw microwave in bath lol
    * livestream ? - Ai Frontlines: Utility Problem (the name changed and now dont even know which one this is)
      * notes
        * Adrian said toothbrush the planet
        * he started whistling - was it same whistling Elon did on Lex podcast
      * my random thoughts
        * i wonder if this is Elon in Cortical Labs chip?
    * ai frontlines, and the human condition
      * notes
        * mentioned [[pention]] is keyword used most by Grok (i think is what they were saying) hmmm
    * community Q&A GrokX Support
      * summarize content
        * i didnt get shit: other than that it is apparently possible to:
          * 1) summarize content in way i need to process spaces quickly
          * 2) create autonomous ai agent that can be part of spaces
      * how do you speculate without hallucinating
    * stream after Alex Jones space
      * Adrian recommended to store your data on SSD in faraday cage. But why in one and why in general? Also said everything has been ai generated since 2017, but also kinda since 1960...which doesnt make sense to me
      * Also said after 2024, not much of anything is gonna make sense anymore
  * how TOs
    * how to transcribe his spaces and prompt for info so dont have to listen to them?
      * prompt 1 (specific claims):
        * This is the output of a transcription using diarization. A claim is any statement from someone that implicitly or explicitly has confidence attached to it OR you think it has confidence attached to it.
Can you do 2 things:
1) list all claims made by SPEAKER_13. Be very precise, dont miss even a little detail. Check as much latent space as possible. Work step by step and take as much time as needed. Return that list as a file with each claim numbered and new lines between each numbered claim - basically make it human readable.
2) provide me with the total number of claims made by SPEAKER_13. Even ones you haven't output to me yet. TOTAL.

              * surprisingly, defining what a claim is helped a ton. Not sure if last part after OR or what. Now this gives good list of claims using the exact statements from speaker's mouth. Now i want to go more abstract, but still use this prompt too
      * prompt 2 (GPT interpreting each claim's meaning in detail):
        * Nice! You are an expert at understanding and explaining claims in your own words. Each claim you returned previously was the exact claim from the speaker's words. Now can you return a file of a list of all claims in YOUR words? NOT in the speaker's words. Like you trying to break down what each claim actually means, in as much detail as possible. Make sure to return this in human readable format.

              * i ran into issue that ChatGPT would not give detailed explanation for each claim - it just wouldnt. It would respond with abstract wording instead of actual explanation. Ex: this claim implies an observation or perspective from the speaker. I wonder if local LLM would work for this? OR maybe i just read through all claims and then i get detailed explanation for ones i think are important. But if there are thousands of claims, how long dat take for me? I dont think dat work, i just read through claims and it makes no sense without rest of convo.
