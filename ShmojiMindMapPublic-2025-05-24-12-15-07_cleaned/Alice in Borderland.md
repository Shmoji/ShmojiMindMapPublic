      * finished season 2. Apparently meteor crashed and multiple people were on border of life and death for 1 minute. That's when games happened. People that died in game died irl and vice versa. Some exceptions like Ann who barely survived meteor even tho died in game
      * at very end it shows joker card like they're not actually out of the game
