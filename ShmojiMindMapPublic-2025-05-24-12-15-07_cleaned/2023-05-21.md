    * I literally only go to GPT or other chatbot if i want something. So, could create a plugin that stores what you want everytime you chat with chatbot. Then, you can go to link (that chatbot shows you) and look at all your desires. The API could do some cool stuff behind the scenes like come up with ways for you to get your desires. Also, maybe you have the ability to customize these desires if you dont agree with what the chatbot said you desire.
