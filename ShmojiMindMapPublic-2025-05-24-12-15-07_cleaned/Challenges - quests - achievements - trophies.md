  * tracking thoughts
    * brainstorming if i do thing and result
      * [[2024-07-23]]
        * create challenge and then it just sits there and nobody wants to do it
          * so what, maybe someone will want to do it one day...but where will they discover it? just one x post? idk about that chief
        * create challenge and then few people complete and then that's it
          * feels like a way to subscribe to new challenges from different people is needed
    * brainstorming format
      * [[2024-07-23]]
        * could have context on whyspia and then there is avatar of me where people can accept quests from
    * brainstorming wording used
      * [[2024-07-23]]
        * i think i like quests the best, but also feel challenges is more provacative
        * quests can be anything - even easy stuff like going to store, but challenges feel they need to be challenging
    * tracking stuck points for me
      * [[2024-07-23]]
        * if this ended up being really fun, i could see myself wasting each day on it - even tho it doesnt make me money....which is kinda issue rn
          * i guess it could just be once in a while fun thing to do when there is free time
          * also, maybe people could get paid to keep making challenges if they give fun challenges. i could see people that create challenges themself having more success here, rather than them not being active in creation of thing (like go to store - anyone can make that challenge)
    * tracking explanations of this

        * first X post (aside from one about shmoji universe)
          * i want to do a thing. where we all create challenges and then try to complete each other's challenges. just for fun. but each person can choose to provide rewards (like money) if they want

for example, a challenge of "get a win in fortnite"

challenge creators can choose how their system works. for me, it will be based around my mind and trusting me. i will decide if you completed my challenge. i could lie if i wanted to. but i have no plans to. i just wanna have fun creating and doing challenges with people

i plan to keep leaderboards for every challenge i create. i will display them publicly. there will be some sort of "point system" i will create where you can earn points for completing challenges. sometimes i may offer money

i feel it'd be good way to change things up and connect and have fun with friends

if you're interested in this or have ideas, lemme know. thinking about making X community for this

  * Process to create these challenges for people
    * Think of challenges i would love to do if offered by someone else
  * Challenges ive always loved doing
    * Video game physics-base challenges
      * Examples
        * Halo jump maps. Like that one that was race to see who could win recon.
    * Honestly any achievement in any video game
      * why do i love these?
        * Someone else set a challenge for me (and anyone else to complete). A challenge from someone else just feels different than a challenge to yourself
        * if it's a challenge for a game you're already connected to and love, it just feels like additional content
        * It can be fun to complete something that other people can also complete. There is a sort of relation in trying to achieve the same thing. Can take it the other way too, there can be fun for the ego in competition and being better
        * The rewards are super nice, even if it is just fake points. The reward is nice if it's private or public
