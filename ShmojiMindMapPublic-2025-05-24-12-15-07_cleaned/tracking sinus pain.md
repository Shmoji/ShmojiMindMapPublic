      * Yesterday and today sinus pain has been about 7/10. I should have recorded what i ate...
    * [[2023-10-06]]
      * sinus pain has been pretty chill for weeks. After lunch today it slowly got rough until about 5/10. Only weird thing today is i ate beef soba noodle from work. Possible causes: 1) beef 2) the soup or ingredients in it. My guess is beef - i rarely eat it. Will track beef consumption closer in regards to symptoms

      * had fig bar and sinuses hurt like 3-4/10 until nighttime

      * had 2 fig bars and sinuses hurt like 3-4/10 until nighttime
    * [[2024-01-23]]
      * yesterday sinus pain was like 5-7/10. Face and head pain was about the same - which i think is just caused by sinus issues?? but not sure, maybe i should track that separate.
      * my best guess for cause: at work i ate some chicken meal with garlic potatoes which are 2 things terrible for people with sibo. Other guesses: 1) papa is ER with kidney issues and lots of pain - somehow connected 2) yesterday i felt some sort of doom related to myself and future tech augmenting humanity - maybe some spiritual or emotional thing idk
      * i will add that the child's pose with arms down helped the pain immensely - after 30 minutes, felt muchh better for rest of night

      * was good all day, then had [[thai basil fried rice]] for dinn. pretty soon after my sinus pain went to 4/10 and face and head pain - especially near ears, went to 4-5/10
        * here is ingredients: Fried rice our traditional with egg,green beans, tomatoes, onions, bell pepperin Thai spicy basil sauce

      * idk when it triggered sadly, but defs since after lunch i have had about 4-6/10 sinus pain. Feels like tension just kept getting trapped at mid/upper nose and under eyes
      * had meal from work for lunch - grilled achiote rubbed chicken, bulgar lentil pilaf, roasted crimini mushrooms (although i was almost certain they were carrots)
    * [[2024-04-09]]
      * woke up and all day sinus pain was like 7/10 - of course day of funeral
      * near end of day, i had a smoothie with banana, orange, and carrots - pretty soon after my sinuses felt like 3-4 points better for some reason. Cause guesses: 1) orange - but i had in the morning too so idk, but maybe i needed certain amount of those vitamins 2) carrots

      * had intense sinus pain today. maybe bc too much gluten recently. tbh cant remember too well, but i think sinus pain has been more intense than nose pain which is why i document here.
      * i took time to fall into Self and see all pain sensations and pain reduced significantly after that
      * gonna doc this elsewhere for independent tracking, but i noticed on my left face kinda right under cheekbone, i had a black circular indent/area. wonder if this is from some sort of buildup or drainage in sinuses? defs need to doc this. gonna put here: [[tracking face observations]] ^KxbPUJPWP
      * note: im also dealing with [[tracking gum pain issue]] right now too, just started yesterday. Dang could be garlic lol. But yea, these could be related bc spot on face is v close to gum spot that burns
    * [[2024-10-29]]
      * rough night, but i survived

felt like my typical chronic sinusitis turned into a ball of infected goop on left side of my face

some didnt want to move and some slowly started draining while i tried to sleep

got a smell of hand sanitizer from the goop and as it made its way down my esophagus, i started getting twitching and pain all throughout my body - especially in different parts of my gut
    * [[2024-11-03]]
      * sinus pain persisted since last time, but it wasnt terrible terrible before today. Today it was like 7-8/10 intensity
      * possible causes: 1) gluten from burrito at mexican restaurant 2) maybe garlic somehow caused sinus infection on that noted day days ago somehow 3) maybe using the ceramic heater at dads somehow??
      * both sides of jaw under ears hurt
      * where i imagine tonsils or thyroid is hurt
