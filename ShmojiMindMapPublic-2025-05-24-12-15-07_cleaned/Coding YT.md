  * Videos im working on
  * How to create tutorial videos with Medium articles
    * Notes
      * I think my vids turn out better when i write script out and make video by reading each line, recording video after reading line (doesnt have to be same as written line) and then pausing between each line. Probably better to pause as little as possible, but pausing can be good actually
    * Steps
      * Create test project in terminal and get code perf, then make Medium article using that code
      * Once article is done and has all code needed inside it, use that article to create video
      * Just copy and paste code in tut for more time for explaining
