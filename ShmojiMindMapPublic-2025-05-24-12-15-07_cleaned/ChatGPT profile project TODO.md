  * TODO soon
    * [ ] Handle yes button
      * On click, go to new page for that goal. For MVP mainly just focus on visuals of breaking blockers down. Data underneath will stay messages array (but how do i use say variable when breaking it down into separate flows?)
        * messages
          * first few objects are from goal creation
          * blockers: array of arrays
            * each blocker is its own messages array (so other blockers not contained in its own messages...maybe change that one day)
    * [ ] Handle no button
      * shouldnt be too hard to enable chat input type again and continue logic again
    * [ ] Need loading symbol when calling openAI API
    * [ ] Generate advice button for each blocker on goal page
  * TODO eventually
    * [ ] Create same app except use newer tech like Ceramic/Ocean/Lens/etc
