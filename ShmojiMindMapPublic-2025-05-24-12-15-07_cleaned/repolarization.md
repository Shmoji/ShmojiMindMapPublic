  * what is it?
    * Change in membrane potential also opens VG Potassium channels (although they open and close slow compared to Sodium). Bc of Potassium electrochemical gradient, potassium ions flow out of cell after hitting threshold making cell eventually negative
    * Bc VG Potassium channels close slow, for brief period, the membrane potential is [[hyperpolarized]]
  * notes
    * [[absolute refractory period]] happens during repolarization
