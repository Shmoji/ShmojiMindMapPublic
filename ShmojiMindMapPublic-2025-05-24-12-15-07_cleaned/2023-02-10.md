    * When im asked open-ended question and i talk a lil, but in middle of sentence, i realize i dont know what to say next, it causes strong bad feels. Example: talked with Alanna about being on Dear Therapists podcast and she asked why i wanted to be on podcast and i was speaking good for a bit, but got stuck when trying to remember if i submitted reason to be on podcast after watching Very Well Mind poddy or Dear Therapists poddy. Maybe i just need to get happy with saying "oo i lost my train of thought" or "can i think for a moment" or ask them a question to clarify.
