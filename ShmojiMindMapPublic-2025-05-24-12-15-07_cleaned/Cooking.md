  * Thawing
    * What not to do
      * Thaw meat in water just before cooking, especially hot water
        * Encourages bacteria to grow that can literally kill you (need more sources for this)
        * Thawing quickly can leave some still frozen and you can eat raw bad fish and it will taste bad
      * Don’t remove the vacuum-packaging before thawing. Thawing fish “naked” under water makes it waterlogged.
    * What to do

      * Thaw in fridge for 12-24 hours
      * Thaw in bowl of cold water for 15-20 minutes

      * After thawed, cut open, and rinse cold water for second

      * Dry meat with paper towels
      * Use only COLD water
    * Thawing frozen veggies

      * No need to thaw frozen veggies, just cook it frozen
  * Notes
    * Different types of cooking
      * Pan frying
        * Cook food over medium-high heat in a moderate amount of oil, turning it once or twice for even cooking.
      * Searing
        * Cook food at high heat in a small amount of oil or fat for a short time to brown the outside while keeping the inside rare or medium-rare.
        * My thoughts
          * i probably wont use this ever. seems more for cooking rare food, yuck.
      * Sauteeing
        * Cook small pieces of food quickly in a small amount of oil over high heat, stirring constantly to ensure even cooking, resulting in a crispy, lightly browned exterior and tender interior.
        * Small stuff: This method is typically used for vegetables, such as onions, garlic, and peppers, as well as small pieces of meat, poultry, or fish.
    * Using acidic ingredients on a pan
      * Acidic ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice, or tomatoes, can react with the metal in your stainless steel cookware, especially if the pan is not made of high-quality stainless steel. This can cause discoloration, pitting, or a metallic taste in your food. A metallic taste imo hints at metals getting in your food
      * Butter has a low smoke point, which means that it can burn easily at high temperatures. When combined with acidic ingredients, the risk of burning is even higher, as the acid can break down the milk solids in the butter and cause it to brown more quickly.
    * Cooking health risks
      * Using stainless steel
        * Low quality stainless steel can get metals in your food that are not good for healthy (especially when using acidic stuff). This is why Oceane uses ss, but uses glass when cooking acidic stuff
        * Buy American-made and reviewed ss products to check for quality. Apparently Chinese-made are low quality.
  * Using pots/pans/cookware

    * Using stainless steel frying pan
      * How to use
        * Heat pan dry over 3-4 heat until you can hold your hand about 6-inches above the cooking surface and feel the heat radiating upward.
          * Notes
            * You don't put the oil in the pan first because the longer oils and fats heat the quicker they break down and smoke. If you were to add cold oil and cold food to a cold pan and then start heating, you just end up with a big sticky mess.
            * When the oil hits the hot pan it will instantly heat and should shimmer across the bottom like water on a freshly cleaned windshield.
        * Add butter to pan (do not use high heat if using butter as oil)
        * Make sure you're prepared to add the food to the pan once the oil goes in otherwise the oil will start to burn.
