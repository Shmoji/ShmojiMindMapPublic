  * Potential Diagnosis

    * primary hyperparathyroidism
      * current reasons
        * POLYURIA: makes you pee all the time (i pee more than everyone around me. even more than people chugging alcohol even tho i barely drank 1 cup)
        * gives you calcium oxalate kidney stones
        * high calcium
        * high albumin (excess calcium bound to proteins)
        * high oxalic acid
        * low citrate
        * pain/inflammation right near thyroid (used to think was tonsils), but same pain/inflammation does spread to jaw/throat/ear
        * MAYBE: maybe somehow pulsing in ears is related to inflamed parathyroids?
    * this seems to be Rapaport's best guess in general (i can add specifics if needed)
      * Possible name for this DX: CIRS (Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome)
      * From guy on reddit:
        * What makes you sick is mycotoxins. They’re fragments of mold that are biotoxins.
        * They’re not a living being. Not in the traditional sense. Candida would be a fungal infection that lives in your body. Mycotoxins are not a fungal infection, they’re a poison.
        * What makes most people with mycotoxins continue to produce endotoxins is actually secondary antibiotic resistant bacteria infections and hybrid biofilms that contain both mycotoxins, bacteria, and possibly secondary fungus infections.
        * When you break up biofilms and kill these bacteria they release endotoxins and recirculate the existing mycotoxins.
        * If you break down biofilms, remove the mycotoxins, kill the infections, and clear the dead infections from your system using binders and sweating them out then you can break the cycle and recover.
        * If you do not take binders, and do not sweat it out the toxins recirculate and re-establish themselves elsewhere in the body and continue to increase your toxic load.
        * The only way to get better is to remove the biofilms, toxins, and secondary infections.
    * osteomyelitis of jaw

      * Basically an infection of bone that kills bone
