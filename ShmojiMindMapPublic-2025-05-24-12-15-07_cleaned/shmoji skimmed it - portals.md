  * algo
    * take notes on project to find what is useful for me
    * once done, visualize using GPT plugin
    * make twitter post on notes
  * whats the point?
    * to curate projects for myself in the quickest way possible and only continue learning more about that project if it adds value to me
    * to curate in my own language - dont have to make it sound good for audience
    * to share to audience projects im at least a lil bullish on
  * elevator pitch / bio
    * I curate projects to stay ahead, and you get the latest bullish scoop on innovation
    * I curate projects, stay ahead, and spill the bullish tea!
    * Bullish projects curated to keep Shmoji ahead and you in the loop
  * issues
    * past issues
      * ran into issue that i was taking notes here and then posting same thing on twitter, just in different format - seemed pointless since already here. So, i thought about the point of it. The point is that on twitter more people will see it than here. I can help people.
        * Solution: rebrand where the twitter account only curate's bullish projects for myself...and maybe it will end up benefiting others too
      * At first i was gonna post any concept (like what fragments are in graphics), but then decided against it bc dont think that'd be very useful as something to show off to audience. If they want that then they can come here and search it out.
