    * Cant remember if i wrote it down, but last month or so my throat always gets very try as it gets later and later. I wake up with it too, but it goes away soon after waking

    * so last few weeks i finally had money to buy kefir, fish, sauerkraut, goat cheese again. i noticed my full body pain and aching has increased around this time. also noticed been having very vivid dreams, some scary. Makes me think these foods may give die-off to fungus in belly, but not totally killing it

    * Been peeing a lot more lately, including consistently in the night. Pretty sure it's because i started drinking 2 cups of oolong tea, which is caffeinated. Caffeine is diuretic and makes you pee more. Googled it because thought it's weird that Ceylon tea doesnt make me pee, but oolong tea does. It is not because caffeine. This is why: Oolong tea, in particular, contains theophylline and theobromine, which are two compounds that can have a diuretic effect, meaning they increase urine production and can cause more frequent urination. Ceylon tea also contains some theophylline and theobromine, but not as much as oolong tea.
    * Tried black seed oil for dry throat tonight. It helped a good bit, but not completely.
