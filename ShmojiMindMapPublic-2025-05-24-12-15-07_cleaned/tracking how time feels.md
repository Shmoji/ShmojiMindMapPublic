    * I noticed this weekend felt like it went very fast. Im not sure why but here's some thoughts:
    * I left work late Friday bc i stayed to play video games with team
    * I worked on emote a lil bit, but not huge amount - not even enough to stream it
    * I beat Ghosts n Goblins - did have enough time to stream it so obv put a lot of time into that
    * I watched Percy Jackson movie over course of 2 days of weekend - it was fantastic
    * Didnt go to any social events - aside from thing after work
    * The reason i thought to write this down is bc the previous weekend had the opposite feeling - it felt v long and drawn out. idk why and dont have enough memories about that weekend
