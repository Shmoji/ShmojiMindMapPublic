    * I played Shady Part of Metoday. In that game, there is the younger girl that is real. There is the older girl that is a shadow. Younger girl is scared of outside world, judgement, etc. Older girl is scared of inside world. Eventually, they look deeper and begin to work together despite the different things they fear. When i started stream, talking hurt me a bit and i overanalyzed. By end, my voice flowed easily without pain. I felt meh near beginning and good by end. I felt like I changed with the game characters. Why was that? Painful voice is such a common issue for me, so how could it get better in this one scenario despite talking more and more? Did I accept the part of me scared of painful voice without becoming the painful voice?
