      * A prokinetic is a type of medication that enhances gastrointestinal motility, which means it helps the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract move contents through more efficiently. These drugs are often used to treat conditions like gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastroparesis (a condition where the stomach doesn't empty properly), and chronic constipation. They work by stimulating the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract or by increasing certain chemical messengers that promote muscle contractions. This can help alleviate symptoms like heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and bloating associated with delayed gastric emptying or poor motility in the intestines.
