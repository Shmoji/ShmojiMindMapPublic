  * [[Interviewing for jobs]]
    * Talked with recruiter for UPMC today. They want junior dev. 6 month contract to hire. I will work for Beacon Hill Technologies while contract with pay of 50/hour (96k)  without benefits. Once hired will get $2000 raise and benefits and work for UPMC directly. They require drug test and background check. I told them I need 2 weeks before starting after they say im hired. They need Angular and C# experience and micro-frontend experience
