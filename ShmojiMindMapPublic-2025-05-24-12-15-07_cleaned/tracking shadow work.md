  * figuring out shadows
    * RELATION IN CONVO: whenever someone says something to me, i instantly want to respond with how i relate. But often i have this urge to vocally notice what they said instead and not put vocal focus on me by saying how i related. What shadow is this if it is one?
      * I'd say in about 50% of convos people get pissed when ive done this. Like i sucked all joy out of convo by saying how i related. OR they just dont know how to respond bc a lot of times i say niche way i relate and there's maybe not a great way to respond. 
    * CONFIDENCE: i either really like confident people or i really hate them. Sounds like a shadow to me.
    * BEFORE TALKING IN A GROUP:
      * Definitely get feeling of self sabotage. Is there need im denying that is trying to get fulfilled?
      * Definitely feel some sort of trigger with this.
      * Whenever i see someone else be awkward while talking, i feel pain and it sucks. Assume that is projection of seeing that part of me in others.
    * WHAT SAY NEXT: 9/10 in convo i just have no idea what to say and i can FEEL the tension of not knowing what to say like it's an object
    * ALWAYS FOCUSED ON CHANGING CURRENT STATE (FOCUSED ON CHANGE): in many social moments, i notice im pretty bland and i want to be a fun energy. I focus on wanting that change and it never happens. Okay sometimes it does, but rarely.
    * WEED: i dont consume it unless i have no worries about it. Most times i have worries of down sides, so cant even enjoy it occasionally. Seems like maybe a shadow? This does not happen when with others - i will do it in a second if it's a social thing with no worries.
    * GUILT TRIP: i noticed that i grew up always being guilt tripped by family. You SHOULD do this this this. It's possible i have internalized this and do this to myself - which is self sabotage - which may be a shadow.

      * tried asking questions at self and making statements at self. Tried general statements and tried specific. Neither really did anything. I continued feeling relaxed inside and i didnt feel the statements prompted me. Im almost certain if someone else did these same statements at me i would feel very prompted, soooo it's weird. It's possible my pain decreased one point afterwards but not sure. Maybe will try again.

      * Looking stupid, awkward, being incorrect, not flowing on precise predicted narrative i came up with before talking. This is all my fears before talking in today's standup.

      * Gonna answer stupid shadow questions here and see if anything comes of it.
      * why is success not for me?
        * bc im already fucked. my body is already so broken
        * bc it's so far away. i may be dead before then.
        * bc im weird af (in terms of relationship success) and finding someone compatible is like 1 in a million
      * why am i not good enough
        * dont have enough time. With enough time i can be be better than anyone at anything almost
        * i havent proven i am yet
      * why do i deserve these health issues?
