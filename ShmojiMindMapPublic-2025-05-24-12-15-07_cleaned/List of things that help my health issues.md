  * Cannabis
    * Has been multiple times i woke up the next day after cannabis feeling MUCH less pain. It also helps instantly sometimes. So short-term and long-term
  * Magnesium Chloride baths
    * I remember one time i went from unbearable 9/10 pain to 4/10 pain after simple bath. 
    * Why does it help?
      * Abby said maybe magnesium relaxes the muscles in jaw from TMD issues
  * Running
    * Spent multiple days around 7-9/10 pain. Then went on a run afternoon and woke up  next day with much less pain. 
    * Why does it help?
      * Not too sure. Maybe it drained out the lymphatic systems
  * Claritin (antihistamine)
    * Why does it help?
      * Stopping production of histamine stops inflammation, which is what causes pain. However, doesn't fix root issue that is causing the inflammation to even go to the location in first place.
  * Warm salt water gargle
  * Sleep
    * I often go to sleep with 9/10 pain and wake up with 1/10
    * Why does it help?
      * Maybe something to do with gravity hitting me differently? The weight of something is no longer causing issues maybe.
      * Maybe body is cleaning out infection or something
  * Black seed oil
