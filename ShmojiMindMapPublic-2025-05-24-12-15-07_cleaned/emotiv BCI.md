  * tracking thoughts on Emotiv Epoc X
    * [[2023-12-07]]
      * I have access to Emotiv Epoc X
      * The Emotiv requires a solution that i think is just a saline solution (can just look it up) - and requires you to apply it every single time to the sponges for a better EEG reading...wtf this sucks
      * The one i have is indeed one Perrikaryal uses to play games with mind
      * To code with Emotiv requires you to sub up to your centralized overlords - not a fan. Vendor lock

      * about $1000
      * Coworker posted about it. It's one that perrikaryal uses to play video games with brain
      * hot garbage. It is one big hassle and barely works and you gotta pay a expensive subscription just to dev with it. Wouldnt doubt it if theyre taking all your data too without you knowing.
      * okay i changed my mind. it's still not great, but not as bad as i thought. Last time, i forgot 2 pelts for sensing. This time i got all signals to 100% and trained some commands to lift a cube in digital world
      * after about 10 minutes, my head hurt 5-6/10 - it's not comfy
