    * [[3D Modeling Questions]]
      * How do I know how to scale my character turnaround concept image before starting modeling? Right now I just decided to do scale of 3
      * How to create low poly character step by step? ^4-iNH03Y9
        * Find 'character turnaround' concept, download it, and drag into Viewport. Press M on it and move to new 'background' collection. Use clear tools to put it in default positions (Alt+buttons). Scale it larger and rotate 90 degrees around X-axis. Use G to move frontview of character so it's feet are just above X-axis. Go to side view and use G along Y-axis to move concept back a bit ^z2-XCCYYg
        * Shift + Right click on mid of concept head to move 3d-cursor. Shift+A a cube mesh. Press N and reset Location-Y to 0. Use cube mesh for everything as beginner because it has least amount of polygons ^qs_1bqXbt
        * Duplicate background concept to use a side concept image: shift+D -> right-click -> Rotate around Z by 90. Rename collections to side and front. He moves to other side so can model from 3 Numpad side. Line side mesh with box (he uses concept looking left). ^UdUzqfnj1
        * Now can start reshaping. Start by getting cube to be approximately same size as concept head. numpad 1 and starts scaling each axis to fit concept (uses G to move it too). Does same from numpad 3. ^fHAHGyp_h
        * Then, make shape more accurate. Add loopcut horizontally in middle and scale out on X-axis. Top is a bit big so use Alt+Z for X-ray Mode and scale in using X-axis. Do tons of scaling and moving until you like it. Can add two more loopcuts if you want it even more accurate, but don't recommend too many loopcuts. ^uhERl-Q50
        * Go to object mode and numpad 3. Shift right click top of neck. Shift+A cube. Scale down, rotate, grab into position. Use Local axis to scale if needed. Go to numpad 1 -> G on X-axis to lign neck up. ^17vSt25Id
        * Restart neck process except with torso. On numpad 1, add loopcut a bit above middle of cube. ^qNyRcULoc
        * All about simple thinking and movements ^BkN8SkUiM
