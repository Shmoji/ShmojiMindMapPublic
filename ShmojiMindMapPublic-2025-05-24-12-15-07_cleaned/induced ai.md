      * currently has waitlist to use - it's very new
      * maybe targeting big ol companies instead of solo devs? not sure
      * it almost looks like this tech is meant for people trying to fly under radar. Here's some things they say on their site:
        * 1) "Induced's browser has built-in anti-bot detection capabilities that allow it to fly under the radar of most anti-bot measures. You can run hundreds of parallel scraping, data capture or action workflows. It also has built-in capabilities to handle CAPTCHAs and fingerprinting."
        * 2) "For popular tools, you can also use disposable accounts that are created on-demand. For tasks involving clearing payments, you can use Induced's virtual cards to securely make payments."
      * so i joined their discord. in order to verify, you have to connect a wallet and then send a literal transaction. it looks sketchy af. it looks exactly like something that steals all your money

      * Still sketchy vibes for this project - looks like a scam tbh
  * what is it?
    * create virtual AI workers that can automate the execution of workflows on a browser in the cloud with human-like reasoning.
