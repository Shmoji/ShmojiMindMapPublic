      * [[2025-02-22]]
        * previously: a haven for finding alignment. Then i removed the word finding
        * now i just changed to: a place for parallel play, alignment, connection
        * thought about adding: home of the whyspians. or: home to all. or: all welcome - but decided not to
        * and i still feel guided by: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/heart of whyspia#^29TMpz457|core questions]]

2) outwardly facing service: a haven for finding alignment + building tools that make alignment possible anywhere]]
        * i kinda like: do your own thing, surrounded by others
          * LOL: "Do your own thing, surrounded by others (or don't, we're not your mom)"
          * "Do your own thing, surrounded by others (or just socialize you loser)"
          * or maybe: "Do your own thing, surrounded by others (or just talk to people, we're not your mom)" - i really like this when imagining my physical place in Japan
          * Q: does "surrounded" sound like people are watching you as you do your own thing? is there better way to say that?
            * ahh maybe:  "do your own thing, in parallel with others (or just talk to people, we're not your mom)"
            * "do your own thing, with other people close (or just go chat, we're not your mom)" ^a7ZWkaRnu
        * still gets tough when trying to tie these descriptions to how we'll actually make money/add-value. I mean it's obvious to me how this COULD add value, but yea. options for mooney: 1) donations 2) services like alignment/connection help 3) the tech we create...altho i want it to be totally OS and free and adfree

    * tracking pondering on the ideal

        * i wrote blog post on it
    * tracking thoughts on what whyspia is (at least partially through story i know)
      * [[2024-05-18]]
        * an interface to the soul or soulful creations
        * imagining a sort of home world/context with ton of portals leading to other soulful worlds/contexts
        * EDIT: this maybe sounds like the INTERNAL whyspia but not sure
      * [[2025-03-20]]
        * my intro message when joining allo capital telegram
        * Hello! im shmoji. Going through an arduous process of figuring out how to create nontraditional social spaces, third places, and communities. Just yeeted to Tokyo and will be here in Japan for 2 months with no commitments, but this mission. Trying to align everything im doing with this mission, but not clear how to.
        * My venture with this tangibly started a year or so ago when i began making some tangible social apps...but then once finished coding after a year - everyone resonated deeply with ideas, but no one wanted to use them - in same way that i resonate with Farcaster, but still just use X. So im now pivoting towards more alive ideas of community building...but even tho it's more alive, it's not as tangible as code. So that's my life right now lol
        * if any of you are in Japan (especially if share interests), would love to meetup!
        * examples for what i mean by nontraditional:
        * 1) no money required for visitors to third place or community
        * 2) no traditional socializing required. can just go hangout on phone if desired, no need to chat

    * tracking experiences with manifesting whyspia
      * [[2024-06-24]]
        * well it seems emote and whyspia may have switched places bc of all emote domain names being taken
        * still feeling skeptical about it, but also it vibes in the sense that symbol app framing seems so dead whereas this: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/heart of whyspia#^h54I-fAaQ|sanctuary for shared whispers of the soul to echo in flux]] resonates a lot

    * tracking thoughts on "home"
      * [[2025-01-26]]
        * Harry: home is a "default" place. Where you return when you're not going somewhere else.
    * [[forms submitted for emote, whyspia related stuff, app]]
  * questions
    * what would be incredibly helpful for others to do in regards to whyspia?
      * COMMITMENT: experiment with me on the question: is it possible to make a place in cyberspace feel like home? feel resonant, aligned, grounded
        * what would this look like?
        * 1: explore places on the internet to see how much they feel like a home (even if dont feel like home to us)
        * 2: experiment with social tech we build to see if it makes cyberspace feel more like home (like tech that aligns us)
        * 3: experiment with building a literal place (instead of social tech) and see if that gives a sense of feeling like home. EX: building a place to hang digitally like YoWorld
      * NO or LOW COMMITMENT:
        * 1) for you to do what resonates for you in regards to creating a place in cyberspace that feels like home. Create your home. And i would love to talk with you on that journey
        * 2) i update you occasionally on my journey of all this shtuff
          * for me: ooo if you wanna get updates from me, you gotta visit X place in whyspia maybe
    * core questions ^29TMpz457
      * do you feel aligned and connected enough with the people, places, and rhythms of your specific daily life?
      * is it possible to make a place in cyberspace feel like home - feel like a resonant, aligned, grounded place?
    * elevator pitch
      * "whyspia is a home and community where we aim to vibe with life no matter where we are in space and time...which isnt always easy. From the point of view of how we help others: we’re here to help people vibe with life more, when they explicitly feel they need help. Our approach is through alignment and connection with the people, places, and rhythms around a person in their specific daily life. In terms of both physical and digital whyspia spaces, just hang out, create stuff, or take on quests, all while cocreating or simply being a part of a self-sufficient space."
      * "Hey, come hangout at whyspia. It's a home. But also a community. But also a cafe...except more like a community center because you don't have to buy anything. Also, don't worry about traditional socializing - just come hangout without even saying a word if you want. Oh yea, we can try to help you vibe with life more if you want. Yea, that's kinda abstract, but you gotta start somewhere. Oh, we are trying to do all this in the physical world...but also the digital world. We've got ideas for making money in unconventional ways through a quest system. Oh gosh, we've got too many ideas."
      * meme pitch
        * Groks that i didnt really like but has some resonance: "whyspia: Home of life-vibers. Hang, create, quest—get in sync with life."
