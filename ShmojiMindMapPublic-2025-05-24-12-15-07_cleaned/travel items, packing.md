  * everything needed to travel
    * EVERYWHERE backpack
      * what is it for?
        * you can take this EVERYWHERE - hiking, to fren's, to family, on random adventure you dont know where youll be, to camp site in your tent
        * pros
          * got all the essentials onthego. What are the essentials?
            * you can bust out laptop for coding, research, whatever at any time
            * phone charger
            * tooth stuff for if you stay somewhere and need that
            * supplements for if you stay somewhere and need that - no kidney stones 4 me!
        * cons
          * need to keep on your back at all times - unless you get somewhere you feel safe enough to put it down. I can imagine if youre going to concert or something, you could find a fren to secure your bag with in their car or house or whatever
      * what is inside it?
        * main laptop, charger, mouse, mousepad
        * if can fit: laptop 2nd monitor
          * really prefer to have these, but if not, that's okay
        * phone charger
        * toothbrush, toothpaste, shaver
        * bag with all supplements so can take onthego (make sure they are okay for whatever temperature you are in and take out if needed)
          * both types of magnesium, scooper for magnesium
          * iodized salt
    * LEAVE BEHIND backpack (goes on trip, but stays at home base)
      * what is it for?
        * you take it travelling, but it will stay at home base. Think it's obv some items can switch between this backpack and EVERYWHERE backpack
      * what is inside it?
        * clothing
        * Prose shampoo
        * if can fit, yoga mat for sleeping
        * split keyboard (TODO: test if this is needed everywhere)
        * laptop table
    * random notes
      * everything i cant do with this setup
        * record vocals
          * i prob wouldnt do this while traveling anyways. if i wanted to, i could bring my mic and then i could do this
