  * tracking feelings on digital art
    * [[2024-01-05]]
      * im uncertain how i feel about digital art that is photo of physical art. i pondered on why i feel conflict there. i think it's because anyone could just go and take photos of that art. Unless the owner kept it hidden somewhere.

Digitally that's not an issue. Anyone can screenshot the art, but you cant be the wallet address that is the original source of the art (unless you hack them of course)

Back to my first point, i just realized that it's the same thing. Anyone can take photo of the physical art - but they cannot be the wallet address that is consistently generating new content (the original source)

hmm maybe pondering on this just resolved my conflicts here

  * questions when considering if source of art is authentic
    * CONSISTENT: is this person consistently generating new art from their 1 wallet address?
      * could this be someone that trained LLM on someone else's art and is generating new art based on that?
        * would i be able to recognize if it is stolen LLM generated art?
    * can i just message the creator and talk with them to judge authenticity? is it wrong to do that?
    * my intuition is pretty damn good, what is it telling me?
