  * what is it?
    * If a Markov blanket is minimal, meaning that it cannot drop any variable without losing information, it is called aÂ Markov boundary
  * interesting thoughts
    * when there are multiple M boundaries, quantities measuring causal effect could fail. This is because how do you know which minimal subset directly influenced the cause??
