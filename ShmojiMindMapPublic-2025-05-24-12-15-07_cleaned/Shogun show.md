  * tracking my rating
    * [[2024-04-24]] i give 8-9/10, but after first minute of last episode, it kinda got ruined for me
  * characters, groups 
    * Protestant group of Englishman that doesn't like Portuguese
      * accidentally shipwrecked in Japan
      * apparently English and doesn't like Catholics
      * tells Japanese they are merchants. Im not sure correct label but seems they're supposed to kill Portuguese and open trade there for themselves or something 
    * John Blackthorn
      * protestant, English, hates Catholics it seems, maybe hates Portugal and Spain
    * Council of Regents
      * after Taiko died, he feared civil war so he created council for political stalemate to keep peace
      * i think 2 are Christians or have loyalty to Christians for various reasons
    * Toranaga
      * descendant of the Minowara shogun
    * Sugiyama
      * richest samurai warrior
    * Ohno
      * f
    * Kiyama
    * Ishido
      * some reason has most power 
    * Lady Ochiba
      * mother to the heir apparently 
  * story key points
    * in year 1600, 5 different Japanese leaders and only 1 heir can be chosen from vote from all of them, so they want their own
    * Toranaga becomes prisoner at Osaka castle 
    * Minowara - label of what Toranaga is descendant from. People or group? that reached some divine rank or something like that. Think they ruled Japan for centuries maybe
    * The Council of Regents refuse to vote to impeach and kill Toranaga unless English man killed for some reason. I guess because 2 lords are Christian and Englishman killed many Christians 
    * apparently Portugal and Spain split land under legal treaty. Portugal got half with Japan in it. Basically they were conquering all places that were non-Catholic and storing Catholic rule
    * Macao was taken by Japanese ronin years ago and maybe still there but idk. Maybe converted to some Christian form but idk. I think Macao is in Magellan pass between Spain and Portugal...maybe?
    * Toranaga is minister of foreign affairs or something like that and has power over certain things. After learning of secret Portuguese bases from John, e declines Portuguese to leave on Blackship or something like that
