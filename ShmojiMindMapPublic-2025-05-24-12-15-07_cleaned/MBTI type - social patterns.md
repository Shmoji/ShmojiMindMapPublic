  * Most confusing things
    * What functions are "opposite" to each other
  * Notes
    * The Preferences / Dimensions
      * My understanding: a preference is basically what ego trait in these predefined categories feels most NATURAL to you, even if it is not actually what you prefer. Im right handed, so using right hand feels more natural - this kind of thing. A default thing you're good at, but not necessarily the preferred one.
      * I dont think preferences are processes, but more like categories that contain processes.
      * There are 8 total preferences, but each personality type has 4 basic preferences: each type preferring either introversion (I) or extraversion (E), sensing (S) or intuition (N), thinking (T) or feeling (F), and judging (J) or perceiving (P)
      * 1: introversion (I) or extraversion (E)
        * All definitions
          * I and E explain what energizes you. (not about shyness or quietness)
          * Jung’s foundational premise that E and I represent opposite directions of
attention and energy flow
            * More specifically, Jung conceived introverts’ energy and attention as inwardly directed—aimed at the self and its interests. Related to this inner focus, Jung associated introversion with depth and intensity. This can be seen, for instance, in the introvert’s tendency to invest a great deal of time and energy into a single project, problem, person, or interest area.
            * Conversely, Jung saw extraverts’ focus as outwardly directed, leading them to act more extensively (broad area/large amount). We see this in their tendency to distribute their time and energies across a broader range of people, interests, or activities.
        * The E-I dimension also highlights a fundamental distinction between inner experience (I) and outer experience (E), subjective (I) and objective (E).
        * introversion (I)
          * Descriptions of I
            * If low on energy, I's recharge by having time alone or with close friends.
            * Gather thoughts and then speak.
        * extraversion (E)
          * Descriptions of E
            * If low on energy, E's recharge by being with other people.
            * Think out loud.
          * extraversion (E)
            * Extraverts in general, and EPs in particular, are less concerned about committing errors. Their strategy is one of quantity over quality. So rather than taking time to prepare and focus on hitting the target, they simply increase their number of attempts.
            * Talkativeness is not good indicator to judge E versus I.
          * Extraverts in general, and EPs in particular, are less concerned about committing errors. Their strategy is one of quantity over quality. So rather than taking time to prepare and focus on hitting the target, they simply increase their number of attempts.
          * Talkativeness is not good indicator to judge E versus I.
      * 2: sensing (S) or intuition (N)
        * The preferences of Sensing (S) and Intuition (N) represent opposite ways of perceiving and processing information. Sensing is a preference for focusing on concrete, sensory information from the immediate environment, while Intuition is a preference for abstract, conceptual information and making connections between ideas and patterns.
        * sensing (S)
          * Sensing types tend to focus more on details and particulars than on
the way things connect up (relationships).
          * Often focus on the 5 senses.
          * Often focus on past and present.
        * intuition (N)
          * Concerned with how things connect and relate to each other. It is particularly interested in relationships among ideas, in seeing connections between one abstraction and another. Intuitives are more interested in the connections between things than they are in the things themselves. This includes identifying patterns of causal relations and developing explanatory theories.
          * Thinking without thinking. Their ideas and insights often arrive unexpectedly, as if coming from “out of the blue.”
          * Because the products of intuition are commonly experienced as unexpected gifts, its workings are sometimes perceived as magical or mystical. But thanks to Jung and company, we can now identify the magician as the subconscious mind.
          * Descriptions of intuitives
            * Focus on future and what-if.
            * Because of their close kinship with the subconscious, their
routine existence can assume a dreamlike or abstracted quality, blurring the distinction between dreams and reality. This is why intuitives are often welldescribed as dreamy, absent-minded, oblivious, or otherworldly.
            * Intuitives, especially ENPs and INJs, may struggle when it comes to handling S details. Since their minds are often engrossed in abstractions, they may fail to see things that are right under their noses. They may lose track of time, forget to pay the bills, misplace their keys, skip over buttons and belt loops, fail to balance the checkbook, etc.
      * 3: thinking (T) or feeling (F)
        * These are both (J)udging functions. They are in charge of evaluating information, making decisions, and drawing conclusions
        * The primary difference between thinking judgments and feeling judgments is the nature of their evaluative criteria. As we will see, thinkers tend to use impersonal, logic-based criteria, while feelers consider tastes and feelings—both their own and bthose of others—in making decisions.
        * Thinkers and feelers also differ in their areas of interest and expertise. Typically, these are directly related to their preferred judging criteria. Namely, thinkers tend to take interest in activities requiring the application of impersonal logic, while feelers take up pursuits that draw on their tastes, feelings, and people-related concerns.
        * Thinking (T)
          * Thinking (T) is a preference for making decisions based on objective, logical analysis of information. It involves seeking to understand the underlying principles, causes, and effects of situations, and making decisions based on what seems most reasonable and rational.
          * Descriptions of thinkers
            * Value themselves or objective thing their attention is on (like work) over the well-being of others
        * feeling (F)
          * Jung took care to distinguish the feeling function from emotions, essentially saying that the feeling function is charged with evaluating emotions.
          * Descriptions of feelers
            * Because feelers discern a greater breadth of emotional variations and nuances, they may feel that words are inadequate to capture and convey their experiences. Many turn to poetry, music, fashion, or the arts as avenues for evoking, exploring, refining, or expressing their complex and nuanced emotions.
            * Feelers also have a propensity to function as nurturers and caregivers
      * 4: judging (J) or perceiving (P)
        * History
          * Jung didnt use J-P label. Added by Myers and Briggs
        * MY thoughts
          * Seems to be more about how person is seen by people externally. Or is it about how you see yourself by others externally?
        * judging (J)
          * what is it?
            * information evaluating
          * what are they like?
            * outwardly firm, direct, and opinionated.
            * more inclined to directly express their views and wishes by way of declarative statements (e.g., “I feel that…” or “I don’t like…”or “We should…”). Hence, others often turn to them in situations requiring a firm decision or answer. This contributes to their status as potential leaders, teachers, or managers. Their tone and mannerisms also convey a sense of closure that may cause them to appear more formal or serious in their presentation.
          * what they are not
            * Despite what many type descriptions may suggest, they are not
necessarily neat, tidy, organized, uptight, or punctual.
        * perceiving (P)
          * what is it?
            * information collecting
          * what are they like?
            * outwardly open, receptive, and adaptable.
            * less apt to declare their opinions or impose their will on others.
            * tend to express things in an open-ended (e.g., “What do you think about…?”) rather than declarative fashion. They are often perceived as good listeners and nonjudgmental in their attitude toward others, exuding an air of openness and informality.
          * what they are not
            * Contrary to some conceptions, they are not necessarily messy, disorganized, procrastinating, or chronically late.
      * For example, INFJs prefer I, N, F, and J more than E, S, T, and P. This does not mean that INFJs never utilize E, S, T, or P, but when given the chance, they prefer to use I, N, F, or J.
        * How do you tell difference in a preference and a default behavior? I feel like book is not making that obvious distinction.
    * The Functions
      * What is a function?
        * a function refers to one of the cognitive processes used by an individual to perceive and interpret information and make decisions.
        * A function is a literal process
        * my understanding: so a function is a way to categorize the natural functionality of your cognition. Cognition is the mental processes and activities that are involved in acquiring, processing, storing, and using information (actions/decisions).
      * Of the 8 preferences, 4 of them (sensing, intuition, thinking, and feeling) are also functions.
      * Extraversion and introversion do not qualify as functions because, according to Jung, they primarily represent our preferred direction of energy and attention. Extraverts direct their energy and attention outwardly, toward people, objects, events, possibilities, etc. Introverts, by contrast, direct their focus inwardly, toward themselves—their own thoughts, feelings, intuitions, sensations, etc.
      * We have 8 functions: Not only did Jung believe that individuals were characteristically introverted or extraverted, but also that each function assumes an introverted or extraverted direction. Thus, when S, N, T, and F are directed inwardly (I) or outwardly (E), we end up with eight functions (Si, Se, Ni, Ne, Ti, Te, Fi, Fe).
        * Summaries of 8 functions
          * Introverted Intuition (Ni) collects conscious and subconscious information, and then synthesizes it to produce convergent impressions, insights, answers, and theories. It sees deep causes, patterns, and laws underlying sense data. It is characteristically penetrating and insightful.
            * examples
              * Ni film critic focuses on various eternal archetypes or how hood/evil represent projections of moral struggles. Less concerned with details, although that may be good for entertainment.
                * Pretty sure this is how i was with AoT. My brain easily forgets the little details too, although often im surprised when they come back to me.
            * notes
              * There seem to be at least two distinguishable modes of Ni. The first is the calm, relaxed, and zen-like state we just discussed. We might call it the incubation stage. The other mode, which we might call the hatching stage, occurs when intuitions have completely formed and are breaking into full consciousness. This stage is more focused and intense
          * Extraverted Intuition (Ne) surveys and creatively recombines a breadth of ideas, associations, patterns, and possibilities. It is characteristically innovative, divergent, open-ended, and non-discriminating. Outwardly, Ne users may present as scattered, random, quirky, witty, and ideationally curious.
            * examples
              * Ne fil critic will often focus on a film’s unique and particular
qualities—its cast, authorship, cultural and historical influences, etc
          * Introverted Sensing (Si) retains, consolidates, and recollects historical and autobiographical information. It attends to and draws on a concentrated body of past experiences, routines, and traditions (i.e., the “tried and true”). It forgoes the constant pursuit of new or broad experiences, finding safety and security in stability and consistency. It also surveys inner bodily sensations.
            * examples
              * Hoarders: refusing to part ways with anything on account of its perceived sentimental or practical value
            * notes
              * When thinking about sensing, we typically think in terms of the five senses. But the five senses really pertain more to Se than Si. While Se constantly seeks out new opportunities for stimulating the senses, Si is more interested in the routine and familiar. It is a careful and conservative function, drawing on existing resources, beliefs, or practices in lieu of exploring or developing new ones.
              * "learning through experience": This can be associated with Si, which guides and informs our behavior by consulting past experiences. To be sure, all types rely on memory and past experience to some extent, but for Si types (i.e., SJs) the past is granted higher priority and greater authority
              * SJs are famous for embracing and defending “the tried and true.” They are reluctant to change things they see as having a proven track record. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!” is another Si mantra
              * However, as introverts, ISJs seem somewhat less inclined to
function as frontline activists for their beliefs, preferring instead to spend time reflecting on the past and their cherished traditions. Many enjoy attending religious services or studying religious texts, activities that further reinforce their Si beliefs.
              * ISJs, in particular, take pride in “doing their duty,” being obedient, and carrying out their responsibilities. Unlike other types, they are not opposed to receiving or following orders, especially from authorities they trust and respect. Many prefer work that involves following a set of pre-established rules, guidelines, or principles.
They like order, structure, and predictability, all of which imbue their lives with a sense of safety and stability.
              * Detail oriented with tasks.  In the workplace, ISJs may unwittingly irritate others with their tendency to ask litanies of questions to clarify exactly how things should be done
              *  ISJs are actually drawn more to perceiving activities than controlling ones. Many ISJs enjoy engaging with children,
playing word games, working crossword puzzles, crocheting or knitting, reading, singing, or playing an instrument. While ESJs may be a bit less scrupulous than ISJs, they tend to have more trouble relaxing and being leisurely.
              * Si attends to inner body sensations (e.g., pain, hunger, thirst, numbness, tingling, muscle tension), the body as felt and experienced from within.
              * Si resembles the inner knowing of Ni, only that Si delivers physical insights and Ni metaphysical ones. With that said, it seems that NPs (who also use Si) are more inclined to explore this dimension of Si than SJs are, at least in Western cultures. This may be due to the fact that, in the West, mind-body practices have yet to be fully embraced by mainstream culture. Consequently, SJs typically fail to receive the number of exposures required for these practices to “grow on them” and to thereby earn a place in their daily lives
          * Extraverted Sensing (Se) seeks extensive outer stimulation in the “here and now”—new sights, sounds, tastes, experiences, etc. It is open-ended and nondiscriminating with respect to new experiences. It can also be associated with image-consciousness and observation skills, displaying a keen eye for detail. Outwardly, it may manifest as a recurrent desire for activities beyond talking (“Let’s do something!”).
            * Like Si, Se is detail-oriented, but in a different sort of way. Si always keeps one eye on the past, comparing present details to pre-existing standards or expectations (e.g., “Is that a new picture on the wall? I don’t recall seeing it there before.”). Se, by contrast, is less concerned with the way things have or have not changed, and more interested in sensory novelties. It attunes to details it perceives as novel, interesting, or otherwise important. It is constantly scanning the environment for noteworthy sensory novelties, appreciating details that other types tend to gloss over.
            * I think this is Marty, at least when out and about. Always noticing sensory details i dont notice.
          * Introverted Thinking (Ti) utilizes deep and nuanced logic to examine techniques, problems, concepts, or theories. It seeks self-regulation and self-optimization through the development of personal skills, methods, and strategies. It takes a skeptical and reductive approach toward knowledge.
            * descriptions
              * Ti methods often described as subjective, unlike Te methods which are more standardized or collectively determined.
              * Ti strategies are more impromptu and makeshift, allowing for fluid calibration to the situation at hand. Explicit and carefully delineated strategies are more consistent with Te methodology
              * When ITPs sense that others are trying to control them, they instinctively resist or retract. There may be nothing they despise more than being controlled from without.
              * standardized policies, procedures, and protocols (i.e., Te rules) is the worst for Ti. They thrive on freedom to develop and employ their own approach. Often risk instability of entrepreneurship than die slow death among work rules.
          * Extraverted Thinking (Te) uses explicit logic, including standardized methods, measurements, policies, and procedures, to make systems and operations more rational, efficient, or effective. This often involves working as part of an institution, be it corporate, scientific, academic, etc. Outwardly, Te delivers opinions and directives in a firm, direct, measured, and unemotional fashion. It may at times be perceived as harsh, tactless, or unsympathetic.
            * descriptions
              *  is characteristically impersonal, focused more on things and systems than people or feelings.
              * They literally think aloud.
              * From the ETJ perspective, nothing can be optimized unless we work to objectively understand it and control it with standard operating procedures. Such standards should always be clearly explicated to minimize ambiguity and the potential for interpretative error
              * "numbers dont lie"
            * examples
              * Generally speaking, TJs enjoy work that allows them to order, organize, and manage information or operations.
              * TJs may also be drawn to various teaching and training roles. They often manage businesses too.
          * Introverted Feeling (Fi) explores and refines personal tastes and feelings,
contributing to a strong sense of personal uniqueness. It is self-regulating and selfcontrolling, working to maintain inner emotional and moral order. It may also emotionally invest in a limited number of love objects, be they persons, animals, hobbies, or causes.
            * descriptions
              * FPs can often be found helping those deemed unable to help themselves—children, animals, the sick, the needy, the elderly, and so on
              * Since Fi is introverted in direction, IFPs, in particular, may not even look like feelers when viewed from without. Outside of wielding their more playful Se or Ne auxiliary, IFPs can seem cool, indifferent, aloof, and uninviting. Giving little evidence of feeling in their intonations or facial expressions, some may even be
accused of “lacking personality.” While all introverts may at times seem aloof or detached, those without Fe (e.g., IFPs and ITJs) are more apt to be charged with lacking personality. Of course, such critiques are typically unwarranted, since we know that the inner world of IFPs is rich, complex, and animated with feeling. It
may require certain circumstances, such as engaging with pets, children, etc., for IFPs’ emotions to overflow into outward expression. Even then, they still appear more constrained than what we see in FJ types
            * examples
              * may invest a great deal of time and emotional energy in a single individual, contributing to their value as parents, caregivers, therapists, tutors, etc.
          * Extraverted Feeling (Fe) surveys a breadth of human emotions, values, and morals. It strives toward interpersonal rapport, consensus, and continuity. It can also be associated with effective communication and social intelligence, facilitating growth and transformation in others. Outwardly, it delivers opinions and directives in a direct yet tactful way, often with a sense of emotional urgency and conviction.
            * descriptions
              * Meeting others’ needs and maintaining interpersonal harmony are also important to FJs. Feeling responsible for the well-being of others, they work hard to ensure that people are getting along and that their needs are met. Toward this end, they can be self-sacrificing, deferring their own needs for the sake of others. From this we learn that, more than any other function, Fe is interpersonal in nature. In many respects, FJs are unable to think only of themselves. At least in theory, they are the least self-focused of all the types (especially EFJs).
      * But what about judging and perceiving? Why aren’t they considered functions?
        * they do play a role in the functions, only less explicitly. Namely, sensing
and intuition are considered to be perceiving functions. They are in charge of absorbing, extracting, retaining, or synthesizing information. Thinking and feeling are judging functions. Their purpose is to evaluate information and make decisions that contribute to structure, order, and predictability. Hence, the eight functions can be subdivided into perceiving and judging functions as follows:
        * The Judging Functions (T and F):
          * Introverted Thinking (Ti)
          * Extraverted Thinking (Te)
          * Introverted Feeling (Fi)
          * Extraverted Feeling (Fe)
        * The Perceiving Functions (S and N):
          * Introverted Sensing (Si)
          * Extraverted Sensing (Se)
          * Introverted Intuition (Ni)
          * Extraverted Intuition (Ne)
    * The Functional Stack
      * Each personality type uses four functions that comprise its functional stack. These functions are ordered according to their relative degree of strength and development, as well as their availability for conscious employment. The most developed and conscious function is called the “dominant function,” which is followed by the auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions respectively.
      * When engrossed in an activity that fully engages the dominant function,
we tend to feel alert and alive, doing what we were “born to do.”
      * Dominant Function: “The Captain”; the signature tool and strength of the
personality type
        * Dominant fx can be either a perceiving function (Sensing or Intuition) or a judging function (Thinking or Feeling). For example, an ISTP has a dominant function of Introverted Thinking (Ti), which is a judging function, and an INFP has a dominant function of Introverted Feeling (Fi), which is also a judging function.
      * Auxiliary Function: “The Sidekick”; chief assistant to the dominant function
        * Always the opposite type of fx to the dominant fx, so if the dominant function is a judging function, the auxiliary function will be a perceiving function, and vice versa.
        * the auxiliary function can be either Thinking or Feeling for judging types and either Sensing or Intuition for perceiving types.
      * Tertiary Function: “The Adolescent”; relatively unconscious and undeveloped
      * Inferior Function: “The Child”; the least conscious and developed of the four
functions
        * It is commonly experienced and described as intensely pleasurable, even magical. For example, when a thinking type with inferior feeling experiences powerful feelings of love or infatuation, he may feel he’s been transported to a whole new world. Dominant feelers may experience something similar in moments of logical clarity.
        * Your biggest weakness.
    * Function Pairs (dom and aux) and FX comparisons
      * FX pairs
        * Se-Ni pair
          * These inverse functional configurations lead INJs and ESPs to experience the world in dramatically different ways. INJs’ typical mode of experiencing the world is impressionistic. They are less inclined to notice or zero-in on concrete details. They are oblivious to details ESPs would readily register. Instead of consciously attending to sensory details, INJs’ Se collects them unconsciously and uses them as raw materials for discerning what is happening beneath the surface of things (Ni). So rather than noticing the details of an individual’s appearance, for instance, an INJ might be impressed by the degree to which she seems genuine in her presentation.
        * Te-Fi pair
          * Because of the highly rational presentation of Te and the introverted nature of Fi, it can be easy to assume that TJs are devoid of emotion. But their outward presentation belies the fact that TJs can experience deep feelings and develop strong attachments via their Fi.
          * Like IFPs,some TJs are sensitive to instances of injustice, inequity, and victimization. Both TJs and FPs are inclined to turn to legislation (Te) for redressing perceived injustices or victimization (Fi). We see this all the time, for instance, when Fi tragedies (e.g.,school shootings, child abductions) prompt the passing of new laws or the formation of new organizations (Te) intended to prevent future recurrences.
          * From this we learn of the typological connection between deep personal feelings (Fi) and collective rules and policies (Te). The notion of a “fair and just” system or workplace aptly illustrates this Fi-Te connection.
          * Science fiction is another good example, exploring the effects of technology (Te) on individual experiences and values (Fi). This, by the way, is why science fiction junkies are often TJ or FP types.

      * FX comparisons
        * Se vs Ne
          * Similarities
            * Both seek stimulation from and engagement with outside world
            * Both work broadly rather than narrowly, casting their nets widely so as to maximize their opportunity for diversity and novelty.
          * differences
            * Se deals in the realm of the observable and tangible, while Ne concerns itself with more abstract, ideational matters.
        * Se vs Si
          * Similarities
            * Se and Si are similar in their concern for details and concrete matters.
          * differences
            * While Se attends to environmental details, Si is concerned with recalling or reconciling past details with those of the present. Se gathers concrete information broadly, seeking diversity and novelty. Si perceives more narrowly, drawing on past experiences, especially those which have become routinized or otherwise deeply engrained
        * Te vs Ti
          * Compared to Te, Ti is a more implicit and subjective form of logic. Rather than looking outward and referencing objective standards, it reasons and operates according to its own inner criteria.
          * Ti also spends ample time questioning underlying premises and assumptions, desperately seeking, but struggling to find, firm epistemological footing.
          * Te, by contrast, is more forward-moving (especially in ETJs), constantly proposing new facts, definitions, policies, procedures, and so on. Indeed, we see this sort of expansiveness with all the extraverted functions. The extraverted functions are constantly adding and broadening, while the introverted functions tend to reduce and deepen. So while Te goes about expanding the number of T assertions in the world, Ti earns its keep by scrutinizing, undercutting, or circumventing them. One can find this Te-Ti tension in nearly any organization.
    * Understanding J-P designation
      * 1. A given type’s J-P designation (i.e., the fourth letter of the type) refers largely to its outer (i.e., extraverted) presentation. Hence, J types will extravert a judging attitude (firm, decisive, opinionated, etc.), while P types will display a perceiving attitude (open, flexible, receptive, etc.).
      * 2. For extraverts, the nature of the dominant function (i.e., its status as a judging or perceiving function) matches their J-P designation. For example, ENTPs' dominant function, Ne, is a perceiving function and ENTJs’ dominant function, Te, is a judging function.
      * 3. For introverts, things are more confusing, since the nature of their dominant function opposes their J-P designation. Namely, despite being classified as a P type, INTPs’ dominant function (Ti) is a judging function. To understand why INTPs and other IPs are considered P rather than J types, see "rule" number one above.
      * 4: Due to the above, we can make the following associations between the
functions and preferences of the various types (only if these functions are dominant or auxiliary function in an individual's cognitive function stack)
        * Si = SJ types (i.e., Si used as the dominant or auxiliary)
Se = SP types
Ni = NJ types
Ne = NP types
Ti = TP types
Te = TJ types
Fi = FP types
Fe = FJ types
        * Dominant FX category (remember fxs can go into 2 categories of J or P) will always be opposite J-P preference for introverts
        * I find it very hard to instantly know which fxs fit into Judging and which fit into Perceiving
    * Important to remember
      * Preferences (your type you tell people) doesn't directly show you are same as someone in terms of letters matching. Let’s say, for instance, you are working to decide whether you are an INFJ or an INFP. While these two types may seem rather similar at first glance, sharing three of four preferences, they actually share NONE of the same functions. This contributes to substantial differences between these two types that may well be missed if thinking only in terms of the preferences
      * Central psychological challenge for everyone: involves effectively
resolving the ongoing tug-of-war between its dominant and inferior functions.
        * Jung introduced the term enantiodromia to describe this struggle of psychic
opposites.
      * Since extraverted functions are more readily observed from without, one can often discern the dominant function of an extravert simply by observing them. Because introverts’ dominant function is always introverted (e.g., Ni), it is largely concealed from outsiders. So what outsiders typically see from introverts is their auxiliary function. In other words, what one observes (from without) in an introvert is not their signature strength or “best self,” but what really amounts to their “second choice” (i.e., their second / auxiliary function).
      * Places i mess up often
        * Remember that when you see a code (like INFJ), only the 2 middle letters are functions. The other 2 letters only help describe the functions. Remembering this helps derive the functional stack of someone based on their MBTI type.
        * 2 letters can only tell you which function is in either dom or aux. But cannot know whether it is dom or aux until the I-E preference is given (note that I and E word used in FX NAMES, so can be confusing). So, first step is that 2 letters tell name of that FX that is in dom or aux and whether introverted or extroverted. Ex: NJ. J means will be either Te or Fe. Which means Ni will be one of 2 fxs. Cant know which until I-E preference given.
      * How tos
        * How to map MBTI code to function stack:
          * I/E - Indicates whether the Dom function is intraverted or extraverted
          * N/S - Indicates whether the Dom/Aux functions contain an Intuition function, or if they contain a Sensing function
          * F/T - Indicates whether the Dom/Aux functions contain a Feeling function, or if they contain a Thinking function
          * P/J - Indicates whether the first extraverted function in a stack is a (P)erceiving function (i.e. Intuition/Sensing) or (J)udging function (i.e. Thinking/Feeling)
            * Why the first EXTRAVERTED? Why not first introverted?
          * And then MBTI dictates that every function in the stack alternates between intraverted and extraverted, and from that a stack may be inferred for a given type.
          * Also MBTI dictates that the stack alternates between Judging and Perceiving functions.

      * This seems better than a lot, but still not great. The description of J/P does not seem good. In fact, the book "My True Type" directly calls out this site's definition as too limiting.
      * It thinks ENTP, but honestly every question i had no certainty on my answer. I can go both ways for every question.

  * Things that i really relate with
    * [[finding-my-mbti-type]]
    * Functions
      * Ni
        * Associated with: Deep perceptiveness and insight, deep “knowing,” theoretical genius, powers of analysis and focus, advising and troubleshooting
      * Ne
        * may struggle to rule anything out with certainty. They can see truth on both sides of an issue without forming premature conclusions. They may even find themselves convinced by one argument, only to feel similarly entranced by its counterpoint
        * Often chasing rabbit trails that derail their attempts at focused work.
        * Ne can quickly envision alternatives to nearly anything stated as fact. Making matters worse, NPs are sensitive to anomalies and outliers, even to the point of discounting (sometimes prematurely) an entire theory on account of a single inconsistency
        * Despite their sensitivity to “holes” or inconsistencies in others’ theories, NPs may not always apply the same skepticism to their own ideas, at least not initially. When NPs feel excited about a new connection or idea, they are inclined to happily ride their Ne train of thought wherever it leads. It may take a few days, after their initial enthusiasm has waned, for them to step back and consider alternative explanations
        * Ne can also be associated with restlessness. NPs may find themselves longing to escape certain situations or circumstances to experience more freedom, novelty, or autonomy. They may be inspired to quit their job, break off a relationship, or ditch a party in hopes of discovering something more interesting. NPs who consistently act on such promptings may be viewed as fickle, erratic, or irresponsible.
      * Se
        * Se is an extraverted function, SPs seek a greater breadth and diversity of
sensory experiences than SJ types. They delight in exploring and enjoying the full array of sensory and physical pleasures life has to offer. They relish new tastes, sights, and experiences. Many enjoy cooking and sampling new drinks and cuisines
      * Fi
        * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/MBTI type - social patterns#^r2dPEvcQi|Since Fi is introverted in direction, IFPs, in particular, may not even look like feelers when viewed from without. Outside of wielding their more playful Se or Ne auxiliary, IFPs can seem cool, indifferent, aloof, and uninviting. Giving little evidence of feeling in their intonations or facial expressions, some may even be
accused of “lacking personality.” While all introverts may at times seem aloof or detached, those without Fe (e.g., IFPs and ITJs) are more apt to be charged with lacking personality. Of course, such critiques are typically unwarranted, since we know that the inner world of IFPs is rich, complex, and animated with feeling. It
may require certain circumstances, such as engaging with pets, children, etc., for IFPs’ emotions to overflow into outward expression. Even then, they still appear more constrained than what we see in FJ types]]
    * FJ (Fe)
      * Meeting others’ needs and maintaining interpersonal harmony are also important to FJs. Feeling responsible for the well-being of others, they work hard to ensure that people are getting along and that their needs are met. Toward this end, they can be self-sacrificing, deferring their own needs for the sake of others. From this we learn that, more than any other function, Fe is interpersonal in nature. In many respects, FJs are unable to think only of themselves. At least in theory, they are the least self-focused of all the types (especially EFJs).
        * This reminds me of both me and Marty.
      * Fe can present differently among strangers than it does with intimates. At least in many American social settings, FJs feel compelled to be "positive” in their
demeanor and expressions, to put on a “happy face.” In the company of close
confidants, however, FJs feel they can drop the social façade and express their
complaints and grievances. Indeed, expressing their feelings via Fe is critical to FJs’ psychological (and physical) health.
        * This feels like me. I cant do the happy face, but do feel compelled.
      * FJ expressions are more direct and feeling-laden, conferring a greater sense of urgency or conviction in what they are saying. At times, it can feel like FJs (especially NFJs) have fallen into a motivational speech in the midst of an ordinary conversation
        * i think it relate with this? Confirm later again.
    * INJ
      * INJs often receive brilliant insights that seem to come “from nowhere.” I have this, but lots can block it for me
    * P
      * I feel i relate with both J and P, but P more so.
    * NP (either dom or aux is Ne)
      * NPs are hardwired to second-guess themselves. They may feel wholly confident about an idea one day, only to feel ambivalent toward it the next. They find it difficult not to see things as grey or ambiguous. Ne can have a destabilizing effect on NPs’ psyche, invoking them to seek more information ad infinitum. If NPs consistently acquiesce to such promptings, they can end up feeling lost and aimless. At times, they may feel overwhelmed, even paralyzed, by a deluge of Ne options.
      * NPs can flounder when it comes to making big decisions, such as choosing a college major, marital partner, or career path. They may find themselves wishing that external circumstances could somehow decide for them, that fate might step in and provide direction. They may turn to religion, astrology, psychics, or other sorts of external signposts. 
      * while making decisions or drawing conclusions may feel like a perpetual thorn in
NPs’ side, it is helpful to remember that whatever Ne lacks in decisiveness is more than made up for in openness and creativity.
    * NTP
      * The P mind, as we’ve seen, is more divergent, making it well-suited for a variety of work activities, including opportunities to function creatively or spontaneously. For NPs, a key work activity is divergent thinking. For NFPs, this may involve working as writers, musicians, designers, or artists, while NTPs may find creative outlets in fields like engineering, non-fiction writing, journalism, or creative entrepreneurship
    * IP
      * SLOW TO EXPRESS JUDGEMENTS (patient and good listeners): Because their extraverted judging function (Fe or Te) is inferior, IPs are the slowest of all types to express their judgments. This is why IPs are commonly viewed as patient and receptive listeners. Their outer passivity and receptiveness can make them easy targets for extraverts or J types looking for a listening ear.
      * APPEAR RELAXED, BUT NOT: But IPs are not always as eager to listen as their appearance might suggest. As inner Js, they are not nearly as passive or relaxed inwardly as they may appear outwardly. Their inner J contributes an inner seriousness and sense of intentionality.
      * INNER CONTROL FREAK
      * lol this me isnt it?: IPs’ penchant for control can at times be irksome to others, especially in situations involving group planning. Since IPs are not terribly keen on planning and dislike making decisions that affect others, they can be less than enthusiastic when it comes to doing their fair share of planning for a group event. Then, after plans have already been forged, it is not uncommon for IPs to hint or complain about how they would have done things differently. Hence, when it comes to doing things with others, IPs are conflicted. On the one hand, they want to be in control in order to avoid being controlled by others’ decisions. On the other hand, they abnegate control because they don’t like making decisions or being responsible for others.
      * I think this sounds like me, but not sure: When others make demands of them, they can become frustrated or even resentful. Such demands disrupt their self-directed judging process and force them to shift their attention outwardly. IPs deplore being forced to face externalities that they would rather avoid or approach on their own terms.
  * Things i dont relate with
    * EJ
      * They are purest judgers. Not only do EJs display judging in their outer behavior and demeanor (e.g., firm, opinionated, directive, etc.), but their dominant function (Te or Fe) is also a judging function, which contributes a proactive, intentional approach to life. For EJs and EPs alike, “what you see is what you get,” that is, their outer personality is typically an accurate reflection of who they really are
      * EJs are born leaders and teachers. They are direct, uninhibited, and outwardly
confident. At times, others may see them as pushy or overbearing. In the presence of EJs, others may feel rushed or hurried, sensing that the EJ wants them to “cut to the chase.”
      * Despite their outer confidence and imposing presence, EJs are no more inwardly secure or sure of themselves than other types. In fact, because their inner judging function (Ti or Fi) is inferior, they may be deeply insecure. Finding inner control elusive, they naturally turn their focus outwardly, hoping that achieving outer control will somehow translate into inner peace and security. Of course, controlling the outer world is not always easy, which keeps some EJs in a perpetual state of hypervigilance.
