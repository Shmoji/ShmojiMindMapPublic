  * list of star clusters
    * Hyades star cluster
      * only 153 light-years away, the closest to Earth, containing hundreds of stars with similar ages
      * Astronomers have only discovered white dwarfs in this cluster (which i think is normal for this type of cluster..but not sure), but there should be MANY more white dwarves. Where did they go?
        * astronomers think they found one that was ejected from this cluster...so that'd explain where so many went (but how?)
