      * Aspergillus mold species will produce oxalates during their fermentation process. In fact, if I discover high levels of oxalates in a patientâ€™s urine samples, I always look for mold species first and then treat mold as an initial step.

      * note to self: since there is SOO much to remember in terms of CIRS - FUCK DAT. Instead, get all needed tests and just reference this link to interpret results https://hoffmancentre.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CIRS-ESSAY_-PDF-_-FINAL-HoffmanEssay1-003.pdf
      * Can also use that link to see what you need to test and what are requirements for CIRS dx

      * still in middle of SIBO protocol rn. If chronic sinusitis and symptoms arent gone by the end, i have to decide what next. My options:
        * ill retest after sibo protocol. if test good, i can start CIRS protocol which i need to re-remember. Do i even still want to do that?
        * i can try protocol from my acupuncturist that saved me with that kidney stone. He was confident it would work. Required supps and needles lol. At that time i was doing mycopul and other supps and didnt wanna add new protocol in
        * can maybe try thing J recommended - supposed to be for pets or something - im skeptical there. I know it was supposed to break outer shell of fungus tho
