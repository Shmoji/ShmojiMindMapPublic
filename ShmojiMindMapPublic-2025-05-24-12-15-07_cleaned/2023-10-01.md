    * Started mupirocin 2% ointment in nose today. Gotta do it twice per day for 14 days and then at end i can do marcons swab
    * oh shoot i just realized i started a new medicine this morning required to do a certain lab test. I started feeling grumpy around lunch. I didn't even think about the medicine causing it. More specifically i feel like i couldn't et comfortable ever despite desperately seeking it. Examples: eating all the food, but barely enjoying it. Watching comfort shows but no comfort.  ^mQVvrKNVe
    * Around same time mucus went in throat and no amount of swallowing has made it go away
