    * [[2024-12-28]] how to set horizon and vanishing point, basics of 1PP and 2PP #memo
      * a scene can use multiple VPs and diff perspectives, but you TYPICALLY only have one main perspective...such as choosing one VP for OPP or choosing 2 specific VPs for 2PP
      * BUT if some object is clearly rotated differently than those VP, you can easily add new VPs just for that rotated objects. SKIM NOTE: generally, things get complex when you have too many differently rotated objects. You can share VP in groups to help with this
      * limit of OPP:
        * front plane of all objects using OPP always has to face the observer (at vanishing point and reverse back into ur eyes lol). this plane will always be a true shape in sense that will not be distorted or going into distance
      * steps to set perspective for a scene:
        * 1) choose horizon location
        * 2) choose vanishing point location
      * MOST USED: 2PP is most used perspective
      * Q: in one point perspective, how do you decide where horizon goes?
        * in ALL perspectives, you choose horizon by where observer's eyes are at in terms of height of that scene/frame
        * this horizon is then where vanishing points are placed
        * NOT BASED ON GROUND OR WALL OR SKY OR INTERSECTION OF THESE: The horizon line doesnâ€™t depend on the physical ground or objects in the scene; it is purely a function of the observer's vantage point (even if there is a physical separate horizon in frame like from Earth - this would not be ur horizon line since not where observer's eyes are)
      * Q: how do you decide where VP goes?
        * VP will gives sense of DEPTH. sense of Z. so this is where lines will converge or point to. Specifically lines that recede AWAY from observer
        * Q: so if the scene is inside a store and most shelves and other objects recede to VP, but then one shelf is rotated, do you add new VPs for that shelf?
          * YES. This would most likely be more rare (common, but rare bc makes things complex). Usually try to stick with just the main VP(s)
        * how placement of 2pp VPs affects object being created
          * VPs DONT decide how LONG shape faces are - you can just make them as long as you want no matter what (may need trial and error to get there tho)
          * 2 VPs will decide how rotated object is in one of the 2 directions of single global/observer y-axis
          * HOWEVER, VPs will decide how LONG shape faces look to YOU/observer:
            * VP CLOSE to object = face on side of that VP will be smaller and more DISTORTED (bc that face's depth is receding away from you FASTER)
            * VP FURTHER from object = face on side of that VP will be bigger (receding away from you SLOWER)
            * often VP needs to be outside scene/frame
            * IMAGINE: can imagine cube in 1PP with 1 VP and front face perp to your/observer lineofsight. THEN you ROTATE cube around y-axis and it becomes 2PP with 2 VP
          * PROXIMITY: if VPs are CLOSER to EACH OTHER, you/observer feels closer and objects of scene LOOK closer so things are more distorted. if VPs are further from each other, VP lines from objects will look more parallel and you feel further from objects (like looking down on city buildings) and less distortion. me: reminds me of FoV from game-learnings
        * TODO: think about getting dat dudes course
