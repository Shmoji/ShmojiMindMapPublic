    * im spitballing here, but i sensed at vc and in tpot - there's tons of people that want to be financially free so they can spend a ton of time exploring the state space of conscious experience (reality). Maybe i can make some sort of public club of people that do these things:
    * 1) actively try to get those who are not financially free to a place where they are
    * 2) explore the state space of consciousness together (no obligations on what you do)
    * issues:
    * 1) many people would become financially free and then peace out most likely (does that matter?)
    * 2) people need to be able to do whatever they want, which does not guarantee any value will come. So what keeps this system running?
