  * what is it?
    * In Unity, an "Avatar" is a component of the animation system that represents a character's rig or skeleton. It's a configuration used by the Unity Engine to map the animations to the correct bones or joints of a character model. When you import a 3D model, especially humanoid characters from formats like FBX, Unity can create or associate an Avatar with the model. This Avatar is crucial for animations to work correctly in Unity, as it defines how animation data translates onto the character's physical structure
