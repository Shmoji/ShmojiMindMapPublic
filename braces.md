        * gave me 6 bags of ortho elastics

        * i guess ill just replace at every event: 1) morning brush 2) lunch 3) dinner and nighttime brush/waterpik
        * if less than half (3 bags) by halfway mark to next appointment (Jan 12th), ill stop replacing as much
        * gonna try eating with them and see how it goes
        * Q: what if im out and about and cant just put them back in after eating?
        * hmm i think i need to learn to put in and out without mirror
  * tips from ortho
    * if sore and hurtin, chew on horseshow thing they gave. But not hard, just do quick small bites. Hard bite will hurt you.
    * if wire or brackets start hurting when touching gums, can put wax on them where it meets the gums. Then take wax off when going to eat
    * Brush after every meal and use waterpik
  * how TOs
    * how to clean between wires - christmas tree brush thing they gave me
