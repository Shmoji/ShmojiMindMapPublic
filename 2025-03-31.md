  * can i ask a question? #japmemo #[[learning japanese journal]] ^dSnuYJTkN
    * 質問（しつもん）してもいいですか
    * 質問 = asking for info. 問い（とい) = philosophical/deep/inquiry question. 問題（もんだい) = a problem/issue
    * 週末料金（しゅうまつりょうきん）は個室（こしつ）にもかかりますか？
      * this directly asks, "does the weekend fee also apply to private rooms?"
      * 料金 = fee/charge. kin close to gin of bank and you get charged for food
      * こしつ = private room. ko powder...each piece is most private/unitized it can be
      * かかります = to be applied/charged. rental ca-car has fee applied/charged
