	- right after lunch pain was about 6/10 rest of day, it was fine before. Guesses for why: 1) i had mackerel mushroom 7eleven cup + salmon onigiri... don't feel they'd do that to me hmm 2) had drip non-decaf mild coffee... would that do it to me??
	- made mistake after dinner buying chips i thought were wheatfree bc called rice crackers... but while eating i saw they had wheat. Good gosh i hope that doesn't mess me up more
