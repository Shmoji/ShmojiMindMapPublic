  * tracking release of this pain
    * [[2024-07-05]]
      * one of my many fun health issues is most of the time feeling like i have a tight band going from jaw to top of head
      * last night as i was falling asleep i got zapped on a top left molar which scared me tf awake. then in the next 30 seconds the top part of that band started disappearing - the pressure was completely releasing...that was bizarre af
      * the bottom part of the tight band near my jaw did not release tho
