	- Fried rice, pork, xo sauce. Like 3-4/10 taste. i think COST: ¥500. 
	- Meiji ブルガリア ヨーグルト. COST: i think ¥260. 5-6/10 tasty. I think it made my throat get all coughy. Maybe messed with stomach. Maybe caused facial pain. But also could've been the fried rice so idk.
	- Barley and Rice with Pork and Green Onion. Quite filling. i didn't even finish all of it even tho i thought i would...maybe just not hungy today. 6-7/10 tasty. HOWEVER: you do have to heat plastic lameee. COST: ¥538
