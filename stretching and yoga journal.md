      * was doing right hip flexor stretch by just putting heel on bed and leaning forward and caused loud nose crackle...interesting. Left hip flexor didnt cause it. Back exercises prior hour didnt cause it. Prior hour hip flexor stretches on my chair didnt cause it...hmmmm. There was also maybe smoke smell in nose after, but im uncertain

      * I need to fix my forward shoulder posture. I looked at myself while sitting and it was bad. Same with neck.
      * Found this stretch and it felt v good https://www.youtube.com/shorts/47xYUoX6n-c ^ki3JHE2PG
