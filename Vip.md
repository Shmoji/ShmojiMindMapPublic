      * Pancreatitis risk due to VIP : Like I said, I haven't done enough research but Shoemaker always had people take a baseline lipase and another lipase after first dose of VIP.  VIP increases lipase, which can cause pancreatitis if it gets very high. You are supposed to stop VIP if you get out of normal range (which I haven't looked up yet).
