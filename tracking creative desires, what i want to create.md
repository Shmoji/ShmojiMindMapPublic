  * tracking figuring out what i wanna create
    * [[2023-10-31]]
      * i have this strong feeling like i wanna create art. Probably NFT art. I want it to be beautiful. I want it to be mysterious. I maybe want it to teach something or lead someone to a place to learn more. I want to integrate hard boring concepts with beautiful mysterious art. I want the art to be simple AND complex - but the simple aspect really vibes with me.

      * i like the route i just went down of creating video of unreal scene telling story. BUT i think i can do better and more authentic to me
      * next time id like to create some sort of interactive mechanic thing and maybe 1) somehow tell story with it or 2) make short video with it
      * i just saw like 1-3 sec clip on X of 3 naked blocky dudes on mountain, cursor pushes one off into water, a VERY low poly fish takes dude and swims away with him lol - i LOVE that

      * kinda pissed bc i want to create, but i dont know what to create
      * what do i want to see (in the world or in general or from myself)
      * if i just let myself play, what do i wanna do or where do i go?
      * something just resonated: a whyspia context for "where are you TRULY at rn" - where we are at is really where our attention is in liminal space. Would be cool to let people know manually where this is and update in real time ^XfD14Kbcx
      * thought about previous idea - and fee itd be another thing id build but not use bc too much manual effort. it still resonates, but defs chicken and egg problem
      * most of whyspia has been kinda bland art - id like to do something less bland...but what?
      * something that allows people to collect stuff
      * seems like every idea i have needs the value-aligned auth and data storage...so im thinking i need to focus on that. if something non-bland strongly arises, then ill do both at same time, but for now ill just focus on auth/data-storage
      * been pondering on what i wanna create on whyspia and what on shmoji site. EX: the playground
      * well w is shared whispers of soul and my site is just how people learn about me. think ill keep playground on my site i guess
      * okay im gonna use that to play with auth and data storage
  * related
    * [[energies i want to create more of into art]]
