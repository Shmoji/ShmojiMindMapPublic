    * In same place that kidneys hurt, i get spasms - it's weird. Like what is that
    * My predictions for what triggered this bout of kidney pain that has lasted a few days so far: 1) sunflower tea 2) eating lots of sugar at once (peanut butter bowl from Clean Juice and a few cookies from App Cookie Co), 3) running (i doubt it). These are my predictions bc these were the most different from ordinary things i did day before pain started
