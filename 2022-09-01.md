  * Pondering what to work on while unemployed
    * [[Chronic]] Video Game
      * PROs
        * Would make progress on Blender skills which would eventually be used for creating game
      * CONs
        * I'd probably spend entire time learning Blender. So, I would progress in that, but not do anything verifiably valuable while unemployed
    * ✔️Listen idea - I chose this one
      * PROs
        * I really think this idea is needed by the world. This could help people drastically
      * CONs
        * Technology needed to confirm one user got on a call with other user is TOO complicated. Could spend months just trying to figure that out with no success
    * GM idea
      * PROs
        * Idea is fun
        * Idea could be completed pretty quickly with centralized DB connected to wallet addresses. Could then transfer data over to Ceramic once it has big update
      * CONs
        * Possible nobody will use it. I don't even think i would use it. My main people I message don't have a wallet.
        * Thinking about the process, it's too much for user. I would quit when i see i need to paste some huge wallet address to send a GM. Too much work. This is thought that made me decide to not do this one
  * :diagram my first diagram yay
