    * My True Type
        * Kept me very interested.
        * Seems like maybe over time i could find my true type, but this book didnt fully get me there. And just like every other test, the test at the end of this one didnt work.
    * The Zoomable Universe by Caleb Scharf
        * Beautiful images. Beautiful way of explaining our entire universe at every scale.
        * Felt wonder and excitement and motivation as i read each page and viewed images.
        * Some of his writing style is hard to read due to complex way of writing, but not too bad.
    * Bhagavad Gita
        * 9/10
        * can be easy to feel like pointless book

    * Stranger in a Strange Land
        * questions after reading
            * so what realm does those that discorporate end up in? Are they at Mars, but not physically? I think they mentioned Mars in last scenes and Foster and Digby were there lol
            * can Mike still interact with everyone even though he's dead?
            * in stranger in a strange land, can you explain this scene "Tears in his eyes, Jubal turns to one of his sculptures—one which, to him, represents moral victory in public defeat—and speaks reassuring words to it." from chapter XXXIV and what sculpture is it?
                * A: Sculpture is Fallen Caryatid. But it almost seems like this scene foreshadows the death and sacrifice of Mike later on
        * my thoughts
            * this really makes you think about individuality and pros/cons of joining/forming a group vs not doing so
            * Mike is basically Jesus

            * [[2024-09-14]]
                * there's certainly some wisdom in there, but a lot of confusing writing too. i hate when people write like this
                * lots of definitions never given, like that of negativity and positivity
                * it did provoke a lot of interesting thoughts tho
                * things that resonate:
                    * going from discipline society to achievement society
                    * you being a master and slave to achievement at same time
                    * depression is holding that 1) anything is possible 2) nothing is possible - at the same time
                * it ends leaving you hanging. more of a diagnosis than giving any solutions
                * my rating: 6/10

            * mainly just not my type of book or writing. Woman turned from poor and speaks poor to middle class and speaks rich
