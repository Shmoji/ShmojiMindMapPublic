  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Right ear started ringing loudly for no reason. Lasted like 2 minutes. Feel bit of pressure near ear, but it's the common jaw pain/pressure that's almost always there 
    * I have been moving dusty stuff today, so anything weird could be due to dust allergy maybe

    * I ate a shit ton of sugar today, so will watch following days to see if burning increases or any other health stuff
