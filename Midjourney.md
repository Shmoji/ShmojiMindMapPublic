      * Need my own notes for this, but for now here:
        * Parameters are options added to a prompt that change how an image generates. Parameters can change an image's [Aspect Ratios](https://docs.midjourney.com/aspect-ratios), switch between Midjourney [Model Versions](https://docs.midjourney.com/models), change which [Upscaler](https://docs.midjourney.com/upscalers) is used, and lots more.
    * how to exclude things from generated images
      * --no ears, horns, text -- in the prompt to exclude ears and horns and text
    * how to make mid journey consider certain concepts separate and put importance weights to each concept
      * Space ship - one concept 
      * Space <2 collons> ship - 2 separate concepts 
      * Space <2 collons>2 ship - 2 separate concepts and space is 2 times more important
