  * what is it?
    * manifolds describe spaces that look locally like Euclidean space (2D or 3D space) but can have more intricate structures on a larger/global scale.
      * another way to say same thing: locally resembles flat Euclidean space but may have a curved and intricate global structure (imagine a sphere unrolled into flat piece of paper)
