        * One [2003 study](https://doi.org/10.1078/094471103321648593) published in the journal*__Phytomedicine*__ found that all 30 people with OA knee pain who received boswellia reported a decrease in knee pain. They also reported an increase in knee flexion and how far they could walk.
        * A [2001 study](https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-10708) compared H15, a special boswellia extract, to the anti-inflammatory prescription drug mesalamine (Apriso, Asacol HD). It showed that the boswellia extract may be effective in [treating Crohn’s disease](https://www.healthline.com/health/crohns-disease/medications).
        * [Several](https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-15802) [studiesTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28275295) found the herb could be effective in treating UC as well.
        * [Studies](https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-11-129) have also found that boswellia may fight [advanced breast cancer cells](https://www.healthline.com/health/breast-cancer/stage-iv-what-happens-next), and it may limit the spread of malignant leukemia and [brain tumor cells](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-tumor). [Another study](https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.25966) showed boswellic acids to be effective in suppressing the invasion of [pancreatic cancer cells](https://www.healthline.com/health/pancreatic-cancer). Studies continue and the [anti-cancer activity](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2017.05.003) of boswellia is becoming better understood.

        * Additionally, an analysis of 20 studies found that a supplement that contained butcher’s broom significantly reduced pain, cramps and swelling in adults with CVI ([9Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14612852)).
        * Butcher’s broom is used in alternative medicine to treat hemorrhoids and other vascular conditions, as it appears to reduce swelling and help veins contract ([12Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11302778)).

    * L-glutamine
      * what is it?
        * L-glutamine, or just glutamine, is an amino acid. Amino acids are nutrients that help synthesize protein in the human body for nutrition. They can be found in protein-rich foods, including those from both plants and animals. Protein, in turn, is a necessary nutrient for good health.
        * L-glutamine is one of 20 different essential and nonessential amino acids that create proteins. Essential amino acids can only be acquired through food, while nonessential ones, like L-glutamine, are produced by the body. Under normal conditions, your body can produce enough L-glutamine to meet most of its needs.
        * It is a critical fuel source for immune cells, including white blood cells and certain intestinal cells
      * what it may do
        * help with IBS
        * Studies have also reported that glutamine supplements may improve health, decrease infections and lead to shorter hospital stays after surgery ([20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19382426), [21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608826)).
        * What’s more, they have been shown to improve survival and reduce medical costs in critically ill patients ([22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9178278), [23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266696)).
        * It Plays a Role in Intestinal Health. Read here:  https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/glutamine#TOC_TITLE_HDR_5
