      * Just returned from trip home for Christmas. On about day 1 or 2, i started getting 2/10 pain in kidney areas. One of those nights i got sharp 8/10 pains in ribs on front side of same kidney area. The sharp pain could be triggered by bending forward - happened when rinsing mouse when brushing teeth
      * for xontext, after starting my protocol, i have been at less than 3/10 pain for months - maybe 6 or more. But then i go home a few days and pain goes to 8/10..hmm
      * main ideas for why: 1) CIRS triggered by toxins 2) ate moderate amount of sweet stuff with lots of added sugar 3) i ate sausages basically erryday. I was having pain near kidneys and lipase/amylase levels very bad and sausages are known to be bad for pancreas - so maybe something there 4) some weird trauma? only triggering moment i remember is when walking into xmas party, my social anxiety triggered for a few minutes
      * the next 48H after getting back to apartment, my stomach is definitely very upset. Growling and weird bad feelings. But pain already decreasing.

      * got home yesterday. Felt pretty good all day, but was very tired very early. Prob bc i socialized with sooo many people
      * only time i had significant pain was after dinner when hanging with Jake and fam - i was expressing a lot of emotion and it caused face pain entire time - and even after leaving

      * last night and for lunch today has Caldereda, which has beef, potatoes, spices
      * it's a bit after lunch - im 3/10 achy (feel chronic soreness in arms), my sinuses are 3/10 pain - same for head and face pain/tension - maybe a bit more
      * im like 4/10 tired
      * my kidney pain (that im pretty sure is actually my tummy) is like 1 point worse out of 10, but it's been hard to predict while doing this SIBO protocol tbh
      * question i keep thinking on is: are symptoms caused by caldereda (and if so, what ingredients specifically) OR by something else (like mold in house)
      * for dinner had skimpi shrimp Pasta, shrimp, fried garlic. My sinuses got insanely clogged after. Childs pose helped clear them a bit

      * my kidney/back weird ass pain was significant at times - i have no idea if triggered by food, mold, or just the sibo supps. I think i need to get very specific with my tracking of these symptoms. Like do i feel it only when standing up? does it only stay for a certain amount of time? any consistent triggers?
      * something interesting: i havent had top-left gum pain in months - had it today - something in skimpi shrimp the cause then?? ^M7RG9wFhK

      * overall, all symptoms increased while home for some reason (im like 65% sure). I went back to apartment this evening, will watch for recovery

      * morning after returning from home. Had the most constipated poop ever. Took over 10 minutes and hurt like 4/10 coming out. Mainly looked like a bunch of pellets lol. ^jW6mAQW-T

    * [[2024-02-08]]
      * woke up with 3-4/10 painful dry throat. Wonder if related to gum issue coming back. Havent had dry painful throat in long time. Last memory is gurgling salt water at dads. My assumption is this symptom somehow triggered at dads but idk why. EDIT: i sneezed and felt the pain on jaw floor off to sides - maybe that is tonsils? ^pTdeXVkeL
        * [[search map]]: #[[symptom dry throat, tonsils, throat pain]]
      * so just to recap. Trip home triggered gum pain issue, tonsil/throat issue, more sinus pain, more kidney/lower back pain, more tummy pain - quite interested. Some of these are rare, so feel that's a sign.

      * to be fair, i woke up sick af today. So some of this could be caused due to sick. Snotty sick sick - not just some chronic bs.
