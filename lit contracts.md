  * questions
    * where to find explorer for different lit networks?
      * in their v3 docs found another chronicle testnet explorer that looks exact same as other one: https://chain.litprotocol.com
        * this was also recommended in their discord by core team member
      * i found one for chronicle testnet on their site: https://explorer.litprotocol.com/contracts
    * where to find code for lit contracts?
      * this shows all the lit contract addresses and you can use their explorer and go to "code" tab to see the code https://explorer.litprotocol.com/contracts
    * what do all the different lit networks do?
      * me: cayenne seems to be testnet they are recommending. But then there's also chronicle which they are recommending - so im confused.
