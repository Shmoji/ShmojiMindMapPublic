  * What the procedure is like?
    * The day before you have to chug a bunch of some liquid and not eat anything solid. Person on reddit drank bone broth. The liquid you drink is NUCLEAR laxative. In one hour you start pooping and it lasts all day and into next day. Reddit said you feel like you need seat belt for toilet. Also, stuff you drink apparently tastes nasty, but did see one single person that liked it. Then, you go in the next day for procedure. For this person they stuck IV in hand, wheeled him in room, then once in there they start pumping you with anesthesia and you sleep soon after that. You most likely wake up in other room feeling very high
  * General Notes
    * Superprep is what to drink, not other one that you have to drink gallons of. Drink just 1 bottle at one time and 1 other time.
    * Be hydrated af. Drink waterrrr.
