  * what is it
    * list of metaverses across ALL platforms
    * social platform for metaverse activities
    * Extension: share where you're at in the metaverse with friends and see where they're at - and join each other with one click
  * other cool stuff
    * they list metaverse events so you can keep up with what's going on and find fun stuff to do
    * On your profile, you can pin events and places in the metaverse for others to see
    * You can follow people and see what their metaverse journey is like
  * concerns
    * this friend system requires you to create account on their platform right now and none of my friends will be in the metaverse anytime soon. But if could somehow import friends from other platforms and share my location to their web2 platforms...
  * questions
    * I know you can get notifications for something, but what's the details of notifications? What can i get notified of bro?? Events? Friend activities?
  * why im bullish
    * this tech seems inevitable and they seem to be first
    * now i have one place where i can search the entire metaverse (worlds, events, people, etc)
    * now i can more easily get connected to other metaverse explorers
  * things that would make me more bullish
    * they become more decentralized - for example, create a DAO and then use the DAO to decide on what platforms are added to the site.
    * they integrate with web2 platforms in various ways
    * they provide robust notification system (may already have this?) - then i can go to more events and meet more people
