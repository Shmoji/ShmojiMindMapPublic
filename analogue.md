  * what is it?
    * system is analog if it's continuous in time OR continuous in value. Whereas, system is digital if uses clocks (abstract away time) and boolean logic (abstract value)
  * key points
    * Digital is typically way easier to reason about
    * But you cant abstract it all - sometimes you have to bite the bullet and think "analog"
  * digital vs analog
    * right now in 2023 we spend tons of energy breaking analog signals into digital signals - JUST so our computers can understand them. Literal energy. Think about all sensors in your phone, your house (thermostat), your car, at work - most collect analog signals that have to be converted to digital - and then usually back into analog signals so WE can hear them or see them.
    * Analog takes less energy than digital if input to device is analog (which is often the case)
    * Some things like audio systems may become MOSTLY analog, but most things will stay both analog and digital
