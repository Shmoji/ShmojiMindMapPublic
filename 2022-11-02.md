  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Can barely sleep bc keep waking up to my asshole hurting 9/10 wtf lol. Sometimes it feels like my asshole is sucking itself in. 
    * This is bizarre, but instead of trying to exude energy into a solution for the pain above, i forced myself to exude nothing and it worked. Will keep experimenting with that
