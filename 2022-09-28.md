    * [x] Call insurance about dental AND let know unemployed (may get free health insurance). If dental insurance won't work for long time (maybe year), then just pay out of pocket for 3 cavities fixed

  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Went to dentist today. I have 3 cavities. 2 are cavities and one is a filling that was broken from teeth clenching.
    * Got teeth XRAYs for all teeth today
    * I also maybe have periodontal disease because gums go down more than 3mm in some places when they shouldn't and they bleed which they shouldn't. Doc said when they go down that far it is easier for bacteria to get down there and stay. She said my gums were infected based on blood, but not sure how confident she was. 
    * I also need invisalign and after that, a fake tooth put it.
    * So, to summarize what needs to be done:
    * 1) 3 cavities filled
    * 2) gum cleaning called Scaling and Root Planing
    * 3) invisalign
    * 4) fake tooth put it
    * Did back to wall L arms stretch and got campfire smoke smell in my nose, weirdddd. It also maybe helped with pain was having under and on jaw
