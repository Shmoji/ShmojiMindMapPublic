    * [[tracking gum pain issue]]
      * this morning pain is like 0.3/10 - best in 4ever. Wonder if due to Lipid Rescue. Or because im doing 2 doses of MagChloride now. Or because not using sink water. Or because sleeping on back = less clenching. Or something else. Im thinking it's thanks to LR.
    * whole day was great. then after dinner, pain went to 5/10. Pain in sinuses, in jaw, and oddly in left ear. I ate okra meal from Indian place. Legit after first bite my left-bottom foot started twitching. Took PC and some magChloride too, but dats it. 
    * Max pain almost got to 7/10 in jaw and in sinuses
