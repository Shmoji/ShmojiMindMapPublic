    * went back and did meditations from vibecamp again. Afterwards my pain levels are tiny bit better, but still pretty bad. Some things i noticed: 1) during fast in-out Wim Hoff breathing, my throat and jaw hurts like a mofo. 2) felt some interesting energies during 1st meditation and during Wim Hoff. Not sure if significant tho. 3) for a moment during 3rd meditation, i did feel like pain lost control over me
    * waited a bit longer after meditations and new thoughts: 1) mucus drainage all day went from 7/10 to 2/10. Pain reduction more significant than i thought too. I'll prob try this again one day
