    * Still white spots in poop daily. Today it was spread across entire poop in random spots. About size of rice for each spot
    * Most certainly dealing with chronic constipation. Have been able to barely get 1 poop out daily.
    * I ran about 2 days ago and the day after is when burning skin flared up. Does running cause burning skin somehow?? I'll watch for that

    * I am completely open with Marty and he can understand things i say. I've noticed i often limit myself when talking to others because i think they may not understand. Do you limit yourself to others in similar way? Ex 1: a lot of times you say word to me idk, i dont do that to others. Ex 2: i dont tell dad everything because i know he will misinterpret. Feeling of cant be completely myself with most people
      * is it about growth? 
        * I think a big part of value in my life is chasing goals and trying to grow. I want other people to experience that too, but they are closed off. Due to that, it limits the part of me that likes growing, which is big part.
