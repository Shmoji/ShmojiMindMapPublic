  * cool notes
    * sea level total pressure: about 15 pounds per square inch
      * partial pressure of oxygen is 20% - therefor is about 3 pounds per square inch
    * in space suit, you wanna lower the pressure. You wanna lower nitrogen content so dont have pressure at 15 PSI - want it around 5-7 PSI. Keep partial pressure of oxygen around 3 PSI and get nitrogen around 3 PSI so you have 50-50 mix.
  * questions
    * what is difference in total pressure and partial pressure?
      * total pressure: total pressure of all gases
      * partial pressure: pressure exerted by just a specific gas
