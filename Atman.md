  * what is it?
    * key concept in Hindu philosophy, particularly in Vedanta school of thought
    * me: inner self or soul of individual. Beyond ego or identity.  
    * in Hindu philosophy, strong emphasis on realizing one's own Atman and understanding how it's connected with Brahman
    * A central tenet in many Hindu philosophies is that Atman and Brahman are one and the same. This is summarized in the famous phrase "Tat Tvam Asi," which means "Thou art that," suggesting that the individual soul (Atman) is identical to the ultimate reality (Brahman). The realization of this unity is considered the ultimate goal and brings liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara).
