  * what is it?
    * NOTE: axon is also called nerve fiber
    * Portion of a nerve cell (neuron) that carries nerve impulses away from the cell body. <- another way to say=it conducts electrical impulses known as action potentials away from the nerve cell body
    * A neuron typically has one axon that connects it with other neurons or with muscle or gland cells. The function of the axon is to transmit information to different neurons, muscles, glands
    * Some neurons have no axon and transmit signals from their dendrites. In some species, axons can emanate from dendrites-known as axon-carrying dendrites. No neuron ever has more than one axon, however, in invertebrates such as insects or leeches the axon sometimes consists of several regions that function more or less independently of each other
