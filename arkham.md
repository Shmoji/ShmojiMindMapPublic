  * what is it?
    * v
  * features, solutions
    * CHAT ROOMS: Chat rooms on decentralized address/entity/token pages. So it's web2 pretty sure, but still awesome with their tech stack. Can literally go chat about OCEAN while price is fluctuating. Or can go chat on some not well known, but import token address or contract address. Can even chat on your own wallet address or someone else's.
      * apparently can "Earn points for verifying your entity page and engaging in chats." - very web2, but still fun lol
