          * Energy Metabolism: Thiamine is a coenzyme in several metabolic pathways, particularly in the breakdown of carbohydrates. It helps convert glucose into energy that cells can use.
          * Nervous System Function: Thiamine is important for the proper functioning of the nervous system. It is involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and myelin, which insulates nerve fibers.
          * Heart Health: Thiamine is necessary for the normal functioning of the heart muscles. It helps in maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system.
          * Brain Function: Thiamine deficiency can lead to cognitive impairments, including memory problems and confusion. Severe thiamine deficiency can result in a condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which affects memory and coordination.
