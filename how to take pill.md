      * put it in mouth with liquid until it starts getting soft
      * once soft enough, get mouth full of liquid, cap to back of throat, and slam that thing down
      * i actually learned to not let it get TOO soft tho bc then it can break open in mouth and throat and that shit sucksssss

      * first pill i got too much water and then basically choked myself. like it went down, but it hurt bc of choking and coughing. my chest hurt after too
      * right after with next pill i used medium amount of water and it went smooth
      * simply tilt head up until pill is somewhere far back - then swallow (i can maybe add more details to this next time)
