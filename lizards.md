    * green anoles #[[fast memo]] ^kd5rsGtoD
      * these are the green lizards i grew up seeing everywhere
      * learned they are diurnal, meaning they are most active and EAT during the day - opposed to nocturnal
      * they get most of their water from licking droplets off leaves or rocks - wont just drink from pool of water - which is why artificial envs for them will have rocks and leaves near top of water pool and a droplet system or spray system
