      * first time sick in 5ever. seems got it from Bob and he had the flu according to doc
      * first symptom i got was it felt like MMA fighter punched me in stomach 100 times
      * worst part was being achy all over body
      * the peak day, i slept more hours than i spent awake
      * like 5 times i got that one thing - is it neuralgia? - basically felt like i got zapped on left-top head and it hurt like 9/10
      * after most symptoms gone, i got kidney pain in both kidneys about 5/10. Lingering pain. Certain movements did tend to increase pain. No idea why. I guess that could be stomach pain, but in kidney areas on back but idk
