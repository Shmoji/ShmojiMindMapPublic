	- Freshly grilled beef rice ¥690. I already felt pretty poopy before eating, so idk if it hurt me, but i def felt crappy after eating too. So much so i had to lay down and could barely even look at phone. Not confident it was this meal tho. If it was, ideas for pain causer: 1) soy sauce 2) red meat/beef 3) wheat which i assume is part of soy sauce?
