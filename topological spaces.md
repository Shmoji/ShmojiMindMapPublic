  * what it be?
    * ME: you got a bunch of dots (elements) and they can be grouped together based on certain rules explained below. Dots can be grouped into categories, but cant always measure relations between dots (which can actually be quite useful if category stays the same despite transformations)
    * wiki:
      * a geometrical space in which closeness is defined but cannot necessarily be measured by a numeric distance. More specifically, a topological space is a set whose elements are called points, along with an additional structure called a topology, which can be defined as a set of neighbourhoods for each point that satisfy some axioms formalizing the concept of closeness.
      * topological space is the most general type of a mathematical space that allows for the definition of limits, continuity, and connectedness. Common types of topological spaces include Euclidean spaces, metric spaces and manifolds.
      * dumb dumb example for me:
        * Imagine you have a bunch of dots (these are your "points"). A topological space is a way of grouping these dots together into "neighborhoods" or "clusters" based on certain rules.
        * The rules are:
          * You can have a neighborhood that includes all the dots, or a neighborhood that includes none of them.
          * If you have two neighborhoods, the dots that are common to both of them also form a neighborhood.
          * If you have a collection of neighborhoods, all the dots in all these neighborhoods together also form a neighborhood.
        * These rules help us understand how the dots are related to each other, how close they are, and what it means for them to be "connected". This is useful in many areas of math and science.
  * questions
    * why can closeness be defined for topological space, but you cant measure distance of it?
      * ME: well it can be measured for some, but not all is the point
      * ai:
        * In a topological space, the concept of "closeness" is abstract and is not necessarily related to the usual idea of distance that we have in the physical world. Instead, it's about how points relate to each other within their "neighborhoods" or "clusters".
        * In some topological spaces, you can define a distance function that measures how far apart two points are, just like you can measure the distance between two cities with a ruler on a map. These are called metric spaces, and they are a specific type of topological space.
        * However, not all topological spaces have this property. In some topological spaces, there's no way to define a distance function that makes sense. Instead, we can only talk about whether points are "close" in the sense that they belong to the same neighborhood or not.
        * This abstract notion of closeness without a corresponding concept of distance is what makes topology a powerful tool in mathematics. It allows us to study properties of spaces that remain the same even when the space is stretched or deformed, as long as no points are torn apart or glued together.
