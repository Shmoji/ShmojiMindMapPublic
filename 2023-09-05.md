    * I feel like im at a point in life where im either 1) wrapping up a big portion of life and heading into something totally new or 2) i forgot damn it lol
    * Basically thinking about how i can find thing to do daily that is allows me to fully be myself. Currently dont have that for sure.
    * i could do something crazy like go to Japan. However, defs have some things here i need to finish first. I think about braces mostly. But also my app. But couldn't i do app overseas? 
    * what if i treated health situation as if i was just confirmed i will die soon. What would i change about my current life?
