    * tracking thoughts on creating GOOD vocal pieces (sound good and have soul you want to imbue in them)
      * [[2024-02-03]]
        * going off of "if it cant be repeated, then it's good" is actually wrong. sometimes you do get the rare case, but not good way to do it bc those rare vocals can be bad
        * you want to go off of the soul of what you are trying to imbue. that will be repeatable - or youll understand that if you hear it everytime. and youll know what is not as aligned with that soul. for example i just had 2 vocal pieces with slightly different flows for same sentence of lyrics. they both sound okay. not great, not bad. cant think of better flow tho. however, one was imbued with the soul and message much more - so i in one moment knew that was better - and deleted all takes of other flow. almost like a process of alignment interestingly enough
