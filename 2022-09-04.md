  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Changing to do 1/day of Megasporebiotic today, instead of 1 every other day
    * Previously i was skeptical, but now im confident that ever since my symptoms moved to head, i am rapidly losing my hair. It's no longer thick as always and hairline receding
    * Eyes continue to be droopy, blurry, and other. Left eye especially
    * Very rarely when i get gas, i will get sharp pain at weird left rib bone. This is a rare thing. Like two times every 6 months. Just happened now. I think it's gas, but idk. I just ate brown rice, saurkraut, Kakashi cereal, Kefir. Not sure why anything there would cause issues. If anything, it'd be the cereal
    * Urge to pee high today (been to bathroom many times) and havent drank more than normal amount of liquid
    * Been having cold sensations near bottom and bottom-side tum. Also, some slight pain on bottom-side near bottom of ribs
    * Kidneys definitely seem to be hurting today. Both. If not kidneys, then just lower back, but pretty sure kidneys. 
  * [[TODO eventually - one day - dreams]]
    * [x] Setup custom domain for serverless backend
    * [ ] Check contract for how much cDai i have accrued and see if it matches subgraph
  * [[TODO soon-whatiskespingmefromfinishing]]
    * [x] Schedule acupuncture
    * [x] Find out how to export ResultsModel as npm package. Quote: What I ended up doing here was importing app1 as a submodule (with Git) in app2. This way the models can be imported as normal and are tied to the app's default mongoose connection. So i think export entire app as package somehow. Altho they may be saying just put in same repo
    * [x] Check and make sure AWS stuff ive done isnt gonna charge me and mongoDB stuff
