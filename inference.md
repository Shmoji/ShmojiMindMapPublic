  * what is it?
    * in general
      * me: Once the variables/nodes have converged, you can use them to make predictions or estimates about the values of the variables of interest (output)
    * in Machine Learning
      * my understanding: basically the entire hardware and software process that happens when you prompt LLM with new untrained data
      * main thing i can think of to contrast with it: training. training is obv different than inference
    * in cognition
      * Once the beliefs of the variables/nodes have converged, you can use them to make predictions or estimates about the values of the variables of interest.
        * questions
          * does this have to variables of interest in the graph itself or can it be variables outside the graph?
            * primarily deals with variables represented within the graph, but its results can be integrated with external data or models to make predictions or estimates for variables beyond the graph if the situation demands it
