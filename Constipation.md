  * Possible causes for my constipation
    * Claritin. Redditer: anything that lowers histamine is going to slow down your digestion. Dr Ben Lynch has confirmed this.
  * Tools to fight severe constipation 
    * Atticus says an enema is best for constipation. Better than laxative because it gets stuff already there and i guess laxative doesn't. But fuck shooting stuff up butt, so i like laxxies

  * Notes

    * Constipation is due to incomplete digestion anywhere along digestive tract

    * Detailed reasons for constipation

      * Lack of stomach acid. Stomach acid helps break down protein. If not breaking down protein, that can end up as undigested protein
      * Pancreas/enzymes issues. Pancreas produces enzymes and release into small intestine. Enzymes work in small intestine. 90% of all digestion occurs in small intestine. So, issues with this process can cause constipation when food goes undigested
      * Liver/bile issues. Liver makes bile salts that is stored by gall bladder, which is then released to small intestine. Bile salts break down fat to a certain level where enzymes of pancreas can then take over and fully digest the fats. Bile hydrates the colon (large intestine), so if you're deficient in bile, can easily get constipation. Also, too much bile causes diarrhea 
      * Healthy microbes issues. After  food digested, it ends up in colon. This is where friendly microbes (bacteria and yeast) take over and finalize digestive process. They take things you cant digest like fiber and break them down
    * Constipation is mainly issue of large intestines and not small intestines. This is because large intestine has smooth muscle that allows it to contract and push food along this digestive tract. That action is called peristalsis. Seems issue can be in many places, but maybe this is statistically the largest cause???
    * It takes 36 hours for food to go through entire digestive tract
