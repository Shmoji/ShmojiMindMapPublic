  * what generates excessive oxalates?
    * Aspergillus mold produce oxalates during their fermentation process
    * Yeasts, such as the Candida species, also produce oxalates.
  * how to reduce damage when eating high-oxalate foods
    * Take more calcium through something like dairy.
    * Consume citrus (to get citrates) like lemons bc citrus binds with oxalates in way that prevents calcium from binding, which lowers risk of kidney stones (lemons are alkaline btw and have potassium)
    * Potassium is great for kidneys. Only BAD when you have stage 5 kidney disease. But also sodium:potassium ratio is important
    * Consume lots of water - maybe 2.5 liters
    * Eat micro-vegetables for phytonutrients like sulforaphane, flavonoids, carotenoids, chlorophyll

    * High oxalate foods
    * Fructose

  * Signs of kidney disease
    * excessive protein in urine
    * urea and waste product protein in blood
    * excessive creatinin in urine (protein problem with muscles not being handled by kidney). This can also show up with liver damage or due to heavy duty exercise.
  * questions
    * where does stuff in urine come from?
      * Comes from blood MOSTLY bc daz wut kidneys do, they filter blood and turn the rest into pee.
        * GPT: Blood flows into kidneys through renal arteries and kidneys filter waste products, excess water, and electrolytes from your blood to produce urine.
      * There are rare exceptions to above point - some substances, such as drugs and toxins, can be directly put into urine without being processed by kidneys
