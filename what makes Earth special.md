      * earth is the only known planet with fire (which is rapid oxidation which is rapid loss of electrons). basically everything cool about earth is downstream of abundant oxygen (like non-tiny life and fire) - neat!
      * there's some bigger life that can survive without oxygen temporarily, but not forever

          * **Life Without Oxygen (Anaerobes)**:
            * **Microorganisms**: Many bacteria and archaea can live without oxygen. They use anaerobic respiration or fermentation to produce energy. Examples include:
              * **Methanogens**: Archaea that produce methane in anaerobic environments like swamps or the guts of animals.
              * **Clostridium botulinum**: A bacterium that thrives in oxygen-free conditions, producing botulinum toxin.
            * **Larger Organisms with Anaerobic Capabilities**:
              * **Some Invertebrates**: Certain marine worms, like the lugworm, can survive in low-oxygen environments by switching to anaerobic metabolism temporarily.
              * **Fish**: Some fish, like the crucian carp, can survive for months without oxygen by using anaerobic glycolysis in their muscles.
