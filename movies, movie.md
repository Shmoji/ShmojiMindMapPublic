      * feel it'd be better to use filters for this. Ex: just put hashtag descriptors beside each movie name and then can see all filters at top and can toggle each on and off as you please. Nesting them seems to bias them too much in one direction - ex: some movie isnt just sad, it's also 49% funny ^apZI1KvX9
      * it seems using filters breaks the items free from high-level nested categories - which bias the item towards that high-level category - BUT filters require functionality that may only be offered by Roam and not exportable unless some other app allows you to specifically import Roam data and specifically have that same filtering functionality - which is a lot of not cool things. But tbh it prob wouldnt be thatttt hard for me to recreate that functionality - especially with ai nowadays ^wA3pHobuB
      * filters break items free because the toggle functionality - which is not a thing when doing nested text categorization. clicky clicky on and off the categories and watch items appear and disappear ^7PmcPLohA
      * so after this change, going to movies page prob wont be that valuable on first click - but once linked filters applied, you be good. Although maybe can still make movies page useful and also use linked filters if you want - idk yet ^xtXyTXE34
  * HOW TO search this symbol: click filter button on Linked References and filter by whatever you want or by [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/movies, movie#^YFVX9nfOk|common ways to search this symbol]]
