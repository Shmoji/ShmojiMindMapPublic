    * row hammer exploit
      * related to DDR and maybe quantum mechanics will do something similar and notify the simulators of us. Apparently that exploit does bunch of cache flushes on DRAM which heats things up and can cause neighboring bits to flip occasionally. Your intent is to alter target memory by doing cache flushes on nearby memory. Goes crazy on physical stack. Closest things to this are super colliders or thing that measures EPR paradox or quantum computers. But depends if you think P = BQP. If quantum computers can solve problems that are not solvable in polynomial time. Guy running simulator's AWS budget may skyrocket lol
