  * **Are all seed oils unhealthy?**
    * No, only certain ones are. Others like olive oil, coconut oil, black seed oil, etc are fine
  * **Why are some seed oils potentially unhealthy?**
    * 1) THIS IS THE MAIN REASON: Oils that are **high **in **polyunsaturated fats** are susceptible to [[oxidation]], both on the shelf and inside your body. Explanation here, it is complicated so just putting link: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-vegetable-and-seed-oils-bad#oxidation. Basically, fats do important functions in body -> polyunsat fats EASILY can be oxidized -> causes fat to deteriorate into bad chemicals in body -> inflammation
      * Saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated [fats differ](https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/good-fats-vs-bad-fats) by the number of **double bonds** their **chemical structures** contain:
        * **Saturated fats:** no double bonds
        * **Monounsaturated fats:** one double bond
        * **Polyunsaturated fats:** two or more double bonds
      * The problem with polyunsaturated fats is that all these double bonds make them susceptible to **oxidation**. The fatty acids react with oxygen in your body and start deteriorating.
      * The fat you eat isn’t only stored as fat tissue or burned for energy ⁠— it’s also incorporated into **cell membranes**.
      * If you have a lot of polyunsaturated fatty acids in your body, your cell membranes are more sensitive to **oxidation**.
      * In short, you have a very high level of fragile fatty acids that can easily be degraded to form harmful compounds (free radicals)

    * 2) there are concerns about the **excessive intake of omega-6**. Scientists have **hypothesized **that too much omega-6 relative to omega-3 may contribute to chronic inflammation
    * 3) **Hydrogenated **vegetable oils are high in** trans fat**, which has been associated with various health problems. They are found in certain types of margarine, **ice cream**, and **cookies**.
