  * tracking learning what is energy and work?
    * [[2024-08-30]] basics of what is energy and work #memo
      * in potential form, energy is potential for change (and can be measured without change). in non-potential form, energy is change and requires change over time to be measured
      * unit of both: joules (J)
      * so it seems:
        * can think of as: 1 - change of movement of particles/fields, 2 - change of forces due to change of particles/fields in some way
        * work is the transfer of this energy over x time
        * fundamentally it seems moving particles is what causes energy of the different types
        * these particles move and this generates forces. is energy and work just a useful way to detect the change caused by these forces?
          * GPT: yes.
          * me: feels like energy is a predictive quantity - telling you about something before anything or any time has happened
          * me: figuring out WHAT changes from movement of particles AND related fields they are a part of just depends on the types of particles really
          * me: ...seems like it always goes back to a force being detected at fundamental level and then this can look more complicated at larger scales. Mention fields bc a field can change v far away and then at around speed of light, it causes movement/forces at other far away point
          * so you have change of movement of particles, change of forces due to movement of particles, and change at macro level due to the previous 2 (often this change can move far and fast due to fields) - and energy is good interface (and sometimes predictoor) for understanding all this change

    * [[2024-09-05]] energy,work is useful but maybe not practical,intuitive #[[fast memo]]
      * was just randomly thinking more on this. going from potential to potential is work. but again, potential energy is legit measurable energy, so just energy transfer like any other. ALSO: even non-potential energy technically/conceptually is still potential bc you dont know how it will transfer/convert to until it does in future. Potential is just more "stored" change and non-potential is more active change (higher expectation of how change will play out in future)
      * energy: how much can thing x cause change (potentially) and what type of change/how (always motion at micro scales)
      * learnt: even at minimized energy, every thing still has energy:
        * 1: zero-point energy: small amount of energy (typically when thinking of quantum systems) that is there due to uncertainty principle, which prevents particles from having precisely zero energy
        * 2: rest energy: any object with mass has energy just bc it haz mass. This energy exists regardless of object's movement or interactions with forces
        * 3: potential energy: potential energy reflects the energy associated with the forces that hold the components/systems together (bc these systems remain within fields - gravitational, electromagnetic, nuclear)
      * maybe instead of potential to potential as work, you can also think of as position/location change of a thing (position to position). so motion. and maybe energy is the state of the thing quantified in space/time (with several diff types for a "thing"). So then this def of energy tells you about a thing (it's position and functionality based on type) AND how it can change (instead of just being defined as a potential for change - the energy is a real thing and so is thing it is attached to). im not confident in this and dont wanna go deeper bc seems im trying to find out if potential is a real thing lol - but feel this was useful rabithole.
      * but talking in potentials and energy seems great for measurements and whatnot - but i dont think it's practical. really you're seeing movement of particles and the attached fundamental forces and how these effects scale to the fields they are a part of
      * so potential to potential is really: no/less movement to more movement which can also be said as no/less force to more force (and effects of how this scales to other parts of field) - imagining capacitor with stored energy and not connected to anything to release it is good example for this. Then you connect it to something and electrons move out of it and so does the associated force of the electrons/field
      * so, work is really just true change (that already happened) - identified when you go from one potential to another over time and the change is found in between (real-time change is power - it integrates time). But going from potentials is confusing and just useful for measurements and predictions (it scales mathematically) but really going from state of low/0 movement/force to state with higher/>0 force and between those 2 states is where true change/work is found (often takes form of like a light switch turning on, etc) - THIS makes more sense
      * NOTE: some of this makes more sense now that i know diff between potential energy and non-potential energy
      * NOTE: work does not deal with the time aspect itself - it's after the fact. W = F * displacement * cos(some related angle) - so the displacement is known after some event in time has already happened
      * change as a concept is good interface/connector for 1) fundamental movement/force/related-field-effects and 2) energy, potentials
    * [[2024-12-03]] potential vs non-potential energy, use Qs for memo #[[fast memo]]
      * Q: can an object have energy without any change?
        * can have POTENTIAL ENERGY without change (altho time must pass to measure anything lol, but aside from time, system u looking at doesnt change). BUT PE is still MEASUREABLE and is indeed energy. grok2: However, for this energy to be utilized or manifest in any way (like doing **work**), there would need to be some form of change or interaction.
        * Q: is it possible for one type of potential energy to convert directly to another form of potential energy without first turning to a non-potential energy? A: yes. Also, it seems this can happen without *much* change in system, just a change in config of system. There would have to be SOME position change in system, even despite it being potential energy to potential energy
        * PREVIOUS THOUGHT: so this means energy isnt change itself, but maybe closest interface for change? UPDATED THOUGHT: actually i think it might be change lol (even if just time changing)
        * PE requires just time to change, but not the system. NPE requires the system to change
        * CHANGE = ENERGY IS MOVING LOCATIONS: when talking about energy: "change" always means convert from one type of energy to another type of energy (MOVE LOCATIONS: OR just move energy to a different location is prob better way to think of it bc of next Q)
          * for PE that is not converting, i think change is more like = change possible based on current ground-state/static-config changes or something. just time is ACTUALLY changing in system (and maybe the internal ground state/stable/config changes). basically tracking 1) time actually changing in system 2) the internal ground state changes that are the default and 3) potential for change from that ground state (opposed to actual energy moving locations)
        * Q: is it possible for one type of energy to convert to same type of energy? like kinetic energy to kinetic energy. A: yes
      * Q: is potential energy actually energy? A: just answered
      * IT ALL POTENTIAL BB: even non-potential energy technically/conceptually is still potential bc you dont know how it will transfer/convert to until it does in future
      * STORED CHANGE vs ACTIVE CHANGE: Potential is just more "stored" change/energy and non-potential is more active change (higher expectation of how change will play out in future)
      * Q: can you have non-potential energy without change?
        * non-potential energy = all forms of energy not existing due to static position or configuration. They require change (like of position, state, or the configuration of particles or fields)
        * No, non-potential energy fundamentally requires some form of change in system being measured to exist.
        * EX: **Kinetic Energy**: This is energy due to motion. An object must be moving (changing position) to have kinetic energy. If there's no change in position or motion, there's no kinetic energy.
  * tracking learning what is power
    * [[2024-09-05]] what is power first try #memo
      * power is the RATE at which work is done/energy is transferred. it isn't force itself, but it's closely related to the effect of forces over time...so you can basically think of power as originating from force (ehh kinda, many times force is more like a governor/controller of power and power/energy originates from underlying system's particles/fields and the interactions)
      * Mathematically, power is given by: P = W/t where P is power, W is work, and t is time. Work itself is the product of force and the displacement caused by that force, which leads to the relationship: P=F⋅v
      * where F is force and v is velocity. This shows that power depends on the force applied and the speed at which the object moves under that force.
      * there's several other equations for Power based on energy you are dealing with - can just lookup if needed
      * many equations for work too, but here is the fundamental equation for work:
        * W=F⋅d⋅cos⁡(θ) where:
          * W is work,
          * F is the force applied,
          * d is the displacement,
          * θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.
      * power basically tells you how fast or slow change is happening OR energy is moving/transferring (scaling up from tiny particles with fundamental forces attached to them deciding to go slower or faster in different areas of field/system)
  * tracking learning energy in terms of living organisms
    * [[2024-11-16]] how the main macromolecules relate to energy storage and transfer, can you recall the 4 main types of macromolecules, glycogen, name of subunit : composite unit pairs, calories, joules, grams #memo
      * Q: what is my other name for macromolecule?
        * polymer category
      * Q: i feel like carbs are known for being what stores and transfers energy. Do proteins do this too? do nucleotides do this? Am i wrong that this i mainly a carb thing? bloodstream vs circulatory system
        * carbs are main player for STORING energy - short term storage in blood stream after eating, and in liver as glycogen
        * Q: so cellular respiration doesnt happen as soon as carbs get into body? is glycogen always needed/used?
          * **immediate use**: carbs broken down to glucose in digestive system after nomnom. Then glucose enters bloodstream and can be used immediately by cells for energy through cellular respiration to produce ATP IF NEEDED. This process involves **glycolysis, the citric acid cycle**, and **oxidative phosphorylation**.
          * **storage as glycogen**: If there is more glucose available than the body needs for immediate energy, the excess glucose is stored as **glycogen** in the **liver and muscles**. serves as the primary short-term energy storage in animals and fungi (fat/lipids for longterm storage). Starch is the primary storage form of glucose in plants. It provides a slow-release energy source since its less branched structure means it's less quickly broken down into glucose compared to glycogen (linear rather than parallel)
          * PARALLEL POLYSACC GLYCOGEN: also a polysaccharide composed of glucose units like starch. has a highly branched structure. The branches occur at every 8-12 glucose units, which makes it very compact. This branching allows for quick release of glucose when needed because enzymes can act on multiple points of the molecule simultaneously (woo parallelism bb)
          * Q: how does consumed carbs that turn into glucose in digestive system then end up turned into a polysaccharide again?
            * glucose enter yo bloodstream. it's transported to various cells for immediate energy use or to the liver for further processing.
            * **Liver**:
              * **Glycogenesis**: In the liver, excess glucose is converted into glycogen through a process called glycogenesis. This involves:
                * **Glycogen synthase**: Adds glucose units to form glycogen.
                * **Branching enzyme**: Creates branches in glycogen to make it more compact and easier to mobilize later.
              * **Energy Demand**: Glycogen stored by liver is used when blood glucose levels DROP, such as between meals, during fasting, or during exercise. The liver breaks down glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream to maintain blood sugar levels and supply energy to cells OF WHOLE BODY (not local)
            * **Muscle Cells**:
              * Muscle cells also convert glucose into glycogen for their own use during physical activity (i think only intense exercise tho). However, unlike the liver, muscle glycogen cannot be shared with the rest of the body; it's for local use only.
        * Q: is bloodstream same thing as circulatory system?
          * the bloodstream is part of the circulatory system, representing the flow or stream of blood. Blood flowing through the vessels of the body. It's the medium through which nutrients, oxygen, hormones, and waste products are transported.
          * whereas the circulatory system includes all structures involved in circulating that blood (blood, heart, blood vessels) AND lymphatic system too (cardiovascular system is same, except without lymphatic system)
      * ### **Priority System for Energy**:
        * **Immediate Carbs (Glucose)**: First, the body uses glucose from the bloodstream after a meal.
        * **Stored Glycogen**: When blood glucose levels drop, the liver releases glucose from stored glycogen to maintain energy levels.
        * **Fat Metabolism**: When glycogen stores are depleted (e.g., during long-term fasting or extended exercise), the body switches to breaking down **fat** for energy. Fatty acids are metabolized to produce ATP through **beta-oxidation**.
        * **Proteins**: In extreme cases where both glucose and fat are insufficient, the body may break down **proteins** to produce glucose via **gluconeogenesis**, but this is not ideal as it can lead to muscle breakdown.
        * ATP, a nucleotide, is the direct energy currency in cells.  ATP (a nucleotide) is all about transferring and making that energy available quickly.
          * Q: Is atp a protein?
          * POLYMER CATEGORY: No. Nucleic Acid. polymers in dis category are DNA, RNA, ATP.
          * MONOMER WITH NO PERF POLYMER: ATP iz nucleotide - and nucleotide is a monomer. ATP a bit weird and doesn’t have perfect mapping to a polymer - maybe memo one day
          * WHAT IS CLOSEST MAPPING 2 POLYMER: chain of ATP doesnt really go to make polymer of RNA, BUT after ATP energy used, it sometimes can become part of RNA (but after energy used ATP loses 2 phosphates)
          * Nucleotide: is a type of molecule made up of a nitrogenous base (adenine), a sugar (ribose), and three phosphate groups.
          * CONTRAST OF PROTEIN VS ATP: proteins, in contrast, are large molecules made of amino acids and have specific structures that allow them to perform diverse functions, like acting as enzymes, structural components, and signaling molecules.
      * fats/lipids
        * not gonna cover in depth here, but was curious in typical day when does fat metabolism start?
        * DURING MODERATE FAST or WEN SLEEP FOR AVG PERSON: Fat metabolism usually begins after glycogen stores in the liver are significantly depleted, which can happen after about **12-24 hours** of fasting. This isnt most people. For most people, fat metabolism starts more prominently overnight if you haven’t eaten for a long period.
        * **Low-Carbohydrate Intake**: If you follow a low-carb diet, your body may shift to fat metabolism sooner since glycogen stores are not being replenished as frequently (maybe me when only eating beans back in the day)
        * **Extended Exercise**: During long-duration, lower-intensity exercise (e.g., jogging or cycling for an hour or more), once glycogen levels start to decrease, the body gradually shifts to **burning fat** for energy.
        * **Ketone Bodies**: When fat breakdown is extensive (such as during prolonged fasting or low-carb diets), the liver also produces ketone bodies, which can be used as an alternative fuel by the brain and muscles (MOAR energy)
      * Q: what are calories and how do they relate to the discussed?
        * Calories are units of energy. In the context of nutrition and biology, a calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. In dietary terms, we usually talk about **kilocalories (kcal)**, where 1 kcal equals 1,000 small calories. These are often just called "Calories" on food labels and in nutrition discussions....wait so they're....lying? A: yep lol. grok2: This terminology can be confusing, but in the context of diet and nutrition, "calorie" with a capital "C" or just "Calorie" is understood to mean a kilocalorie.
        * Q: what does 1 gram of water look like?
          * like a lil droplet about 12.4mm (2 erasers) in diameter if totally spherical
          * If you were to use an eye dropper, it would be roughly the size of one full drop from a standard dropper.
        * **Caloric Content of Macromolecules**:
          * **Carbohydrates**: Provide about **4 Calories per gram**
          * **Proteins**: Also provide about **4 Calories per gram**
          * **Fats**: Provide about **9 Calories per gram**, making them the most energy-dense macronutrient. This high caloric content makes fats ideal for long-term energy storage.
        * me: calories is just another term for energy lol - just a useful type of unit to measure energy.
        * me: cals are gramOfWater:degreeCelsius pair representing energy/joules underneath
        * also, it maps grams/kg of food to grams/kg of water being heated up - without you even needing to know how many grams that food is (you can just take calories per SERVING and map straight to water example to understand energy amount - but also helps to relate that energy example back to serving size...like 20 raisins...and dont even need to care about grams number, but can if want to lol)
        * 1 liter OF WATER = 1000 grams/1kg (different substances are different for this mapping)
        * Calories measure the potential energy that foods provide.
        * The number of calories you need depends on your body's energy requirements (basal metabolic rate, physical activity, etc.). If you consume more calories than your body needs, the excess is stored primarily as fat for later use (maybe glycogen too). Conversely, if you consume fewer calories than you need, your body will break down stored energy (fats, and eventually proteins) to meet its energy demands.
        * Q: can it be any liquid or is it important to be water?
          * important to be defined as water bc every substance has different specific heat capacity SHC. Water's SHC is unique and pretty high: 4.186 joules per gram per degree Celsius - so, each 1 degree C change can absorb (or release) 4.186 joules - can think of it as limit on temp change by energy amount or limit on energy amount by temp change
          * SHC: 
            * **Physical Property**: This reflects the ability of a substance to store heat energy. It's an intensive property, meaning it doesn't depend on the amount of substance but rather on the material itself.
            * high SHC means takes more energy (eaten or released) to change da temp
            * **Units**: Typically measured in joules per gram per degree Celsius (J/g·°C) or joules per kilogram per Kelvin (J/kg·K)
            * i thought this vibed similar to capacitance and grok2 agreed: **Energy Storage and Release**: Just as a capacitor can store and then release electrical energy, a substance with a high specific heat capacity can absorb heat energy (like water does) and then release it slowly, acting as a thermal "buffer". temp change similar to voltage change. Voltage change per charge change. Energy change per temp change
        * Q: what is a joule?
          * one joule is equivalent to the energy expended by applying a force of one newton to move an object one meter. A joule can also be thought of as the amount of energy transferred when one watt of power is used for one second (i.e., one watt-second).
          * ### Examples of Energy in Joules:
            * Lifting a small apple (about 100 grams) one meter vertically against gravity uses about **1 joule** of energy and requires about 1N of force (f=ma, 0.1kg*9.8m/s^2=0.98N). make acc 1 and 1kg and thaz also 1N
            * A typical household light bulb consumes **60 joules** of energy per second (60 watts). This is **incandescent light bulb**
            * This type of bulb was very common before the widespread adoption of more energy-efficient options like:
              * **Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs)**
              * **LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)**
              * An equivalent LED bulb might consume around 8 to 12 watts
              * A CFL equivalent might use around 13 to 15 watts
        * Q: so if a carb offers 4 calories, is it best to imagine 4 grams heated 1 degree or imagine 1 gram heated 4 degrees?
          * AHH my initial thinking didnt have units of carbs woops. iz 1 gram of carbs that iz 4 Cals, not 1 carb lol
          * tbh best to start thinking from food and go from there with knowledge of a bomb calorimeter
          * 1 gram of carbohydrate provides 4 kilocalories (Calories) of energy
          * **Calorimetry**: The energy content of food is measured using a bomb calorimeter, where the food is burned and the heat released is used to raise the temperature of water. The amount of heat this generates is then related back to how many grams of water could be heated by 1 degree Celsius with that energy.
          * i just visualize **1 gram of a carb** as 1 drop of water from dropper now lol. But thought these were good visualizations too:
            * **Volume of Rice or Grains**:
              * A level teaspoon of uncooked white rice or other small grains might be close to around 4-5 grams. Visualizing a quarter of a teaspoon gives you a rough idea of 1 gram.
            * **Pasta or Cereal Comparison**:
              * A piece of pasta about half an inch long or a small flake of cereal can represent about 1 gram.
            * **Using Common Foods**:
              * **Apple Slice**: A very small slice of an apple, about the size of your thumbnail, might come close to a gram of carbs.
              * **Grape**: One small grape is approximately 1 gram of carbs.
            * **Comparing to Familiar Sizes**:
              * A gram of carbs might look like:
              * A small piece of a cracker
              * A small 1inch segment of a banana
              * A couple of raisins
          * **imagine 1 gram of carbohydrate** (4 Cals) providing enough energy to heat **1 kilogram of water by 4 degrees Celsius** (since 1 kilocalorie = 1,000 calories, and 4 kilocalories would be enough to heat 1 kg by 4 degrees). meme" the 0s of the kcals go to the kgOfWater and 4 goes to the degrees
          * **Visualization**: Heating 1 kilogram of water (which is 1,000 grams, and about a liter - half-milk container) by 4 degrees Celsius is a more manageable mental image than trying to visualize heating 4,000 grams of water by 1 degree Celsius. That amount of water and degree change ratio just isnt as relatable.
          * Q: what does liter look like?
            * half milk container (iz about 1.89L tho). coke bottle that is kinda medium - smaller size before the typical 2L bottle you typically see
            * There are **3.78 liters in a US gallon**. For the UK gallon, there are **4.5 liters in an imperial gallon**. However, unless specified otherwise, "gallon" usually refers to the US gallon in most contexts. (NOTE: UK does usually use metric system, but not here bc there is no metric system for this. And membuh US gallon not same as imperial, despite US typically using imperial measurements). meme: half-gal milk isnt 1L, iz 1.89L...which double to get 1 Gallon
          * **Direct Application**: When you're eating or planning to eat, you think in terms of grams of food (not really, more in terms of serving size on label). Knowing that 1 gram of carbohydrate gives you the energy to theoretically heat 1 kg/half-milk of water by 4 degrees Celsius provides a direct, understandable link between the food you consume and the energy it provides. So, while the energy from food doesn't actually go into heating water in your body, this analogy serves as a simple, relatable way to understand the caloric/energy content of food
          * actually i dont rlly think in terms of grams, i go off serving size on label and dont even worry about grams of food - yo these 22 choco raisins that are the serving size give 130 Cals per serving...so that means just 22 of dem heat 1kg of water by 130C...and 100C is boiling point...yo daz in yo body
      * Q: what are macromolecules?
        * carbs, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids
        * large, complex molecules that are essential for life and are made up of smaller subunits called **monomers** - that create a larger composed unit called a polymer (subunit : composite unit pairs...p and m being most generalized version). These macromolecules play critical roles in the structure, function, and regulation of cells and organisms.
        * ex of a pair: carbs (i call a polymer category...or macromolecule): monosaccharide subunits (like glucose) creating composite polysaccharide (like starch or glycogen)
      * Q: for everything discussed, is this just for humans or is this same in all animals? all life at all scales?
        * about same across all at all scales. Bit different though in specific ways.
      * Q: do Celsius change at same rate as Farenheight?
        * different rates. 1 degree Celsius change equals **1.8 degrees Fahrenheit** change
        * Here are some examples to illustrate:
          * If the temperature changes by 1°C, it changes by 1.8°F.
          * If the temperature changes by 5°C, it changes by 5×1.8=9°F
          * NOTE: these rates of change are diff than converting between the 2. They arent temps, they are changes in temp (not an absolute/all temperature, you're only concerned with how much the temperature changes, not its starting point, dont need to account for the offset between the zero points of the scales)
          * NOTE: start/zero point comes from freezing point of water and between 2 scales the freezing point iz difference of 32...so thaz where that num comes from - bet you can guess what each's fpoint iz
          * quick way to convert between the 2:
          * C to F:
            * **For an exact conversion:** **Multiply by 1.8** (or 9/5) and then **add 32**. EX: 20C = 68F
            * quick conversion: double C, sub 10% of result from result, then add 32
            * EX: 20C = 68F
            * learnt: there was another quick conversion process i was given that was not accurate AT ALL
            * me: feel u can just leave out percent part and iz more approximate but still pretty accurate
          * F to C:
            * **For an exact conversion:** **Subtract 32** and then **multiply by 5/9** (or divide by 1.8). EX: 98F = 36.66C
            * quick conversion: sub 32, divide result by 2, add 10% of result to result
            * EX: 98F = 36.3C
      * Q: how many lbs is a kg (~half of half galmilk jug)?
        * 1 kilogram = 2.2 pounds (approximately) - ooo 1kg weighs more
        * 1 pound ≈ 0.45 kilograms
        * NOTE: on EARTH, 1lbm is about always 1lbf
        * wow...so ur heating half of half milk jug of water by 4C/7.2F with just one gram of carbs (4 Calories)...but almost never does your body actually use that energy as instant as water being heated
        * best way to convert between them:
          * kg to lb: just multiply kg by 2.2 (double it basically and add lil more)
          * lb to kg: just multiply lb by 0.45 (half it basically and minus lil more)
      * James: your average lunch is basically a small campfire lol (campfire is bit more energy/watts, but still). However, this comparison is quite rough because the energy from food is utilized by the body over a much longer period and in a biological process, unlike the immediate and external heat from a fire.
      * memo updates
        * [[2024-11-19]]
          * kinda forgot 1000g = 1 liter...but then also learned thaz only for WATER...iz different for different substances (but rlly only need to know for water)
          * kinda forgot nums for how many liters in a gallon
          * i cheated with kg to lb conversion lol
          * for temp unit conversion, confuses me that you multiply first and then +32 for CtoF, but you -32 first and then divide for FtoC. hmm maybe my brain can understand that 32 is just for MR F, so C only wants to deal with it last, but F needs to deal with it 1st for sake of C....lol
          * learned to convert between kg and lb

          * mixed up glucogenesis (no idea if real, i only learned about gluconeogenesis) with glycogenesis woops
          * and glycolysis is somehow related to instant use of glucose in bloodstream
        * [[2024-12-13]]
          * knew gluconeogenesis this time, but mixed up glycolysis and glycogenesis (let there BE glycogen)
          * mixed up SHC being what determines calories content of each macromolecule. but iz not, for all macros, you using SHC of water after that macro was burnt (but cal content iz representative of energy/J of that 1g burnt). Cals use water and hence SHC of water always to determine energy/J or burnt 1g of whatever
          * 1 calorie is about 4J bc of how it be tied to water/SHC. so *4 to get in J lol
