  * anecdotes
    * someone on reddit was looking for something with all features of [[emotiv BCI]] (especially with training commands), but something less centralized - they went with neurosity. They were gonna do OpenBCI, but seems a lot of functionality has to be built from ground up by you for those devices (on hardware and software side). Pros and cons to that
