  * what is adventure FOR ME
    * new novel experience
    * getting lost in the moment
    * the moment rn is very aligned with your desires in some way. If the majority of the moment is not aligned with with your desires in some way, there's a good chance it's not an adventure - or at least not the type of adventure im interested in. If you look at moment and think "i didnt sign up for this" in a negative way - that's not adventure. If you think "i didnt sign up for this" in positive and neutral way, then that's adventure. The negative side can be part of an adventure, but as a whole it is not. Im not totally confident in any of what im saying here lol. It feels like im narrowing in on type of adventure i DESIRE - but is that type that is best for me? idk
