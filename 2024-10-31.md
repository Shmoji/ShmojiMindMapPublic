  * gonna test some shizzz #memo-testing ^Lt2AWWi0I
    * i wanna make this use custom time but then back on regular algo eventually
    * i set to "review every 2 days" - today is monday and will review wednesday. next i wanna change it back to regular algo and see where it leaves off...how long will it make me wait next? A: it left off with "review tomorrow"
    * last move: said Perfect. will be curious what happens if next i change back to 2 day interval and then go back to algo (will it be review tomorrow or continue old algo)
    * last move: if i did perfect it would be "review saturday" which is like 6 days from now, but i no do dis.  i change back to 2 day interval. next gotta see what happens when go back to algo
    * last move: changed back to algo and it broken. it says "review a month ago" lol. just gonna chose Perfect despite good saying same thing
    * last: broken again and says same as last time. choosing Perfect again lol
    * DONE: okay this no work lol
