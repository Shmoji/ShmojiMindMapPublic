    * Today burning skin started bad early in day and got worse throughout day. Noticed today the left rib pain was about 3/10 when sitting in certain positions. Need to watch to see if related 
    * Haven't ðŸ’© in prob more than 24H. Maybe that's what causes pain in left rib. Also having gurgling bladder area, maybe related
