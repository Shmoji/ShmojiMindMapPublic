    * what is it
      * moon goes in front of sun from POV of person on Earth
    * tracking thoughts
      * [[2024-04-08]]
        * saw solar eclipse today with James and Becca at lake in Durham. Wont be another in North America until like 2045 apparently
        * apparently solar eclipses happen a few times per year, but rare to happen in one area often
        * will be one in Iceland around 2026 - could go there to see solar eclipse AND aurora borealis at same time maybe
