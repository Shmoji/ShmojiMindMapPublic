  * motivations to get me working
    * ANGER, LOVE, PROTECT: imagine all the pain and suffering youve seen multiple old family members in. think of the intricate details of that suffering. now imagine them happy and the intricacies of those times and how they deserved more and how with different butterfly effect they could have all that meaningless pain fixed (okay this was a rant lol)
    * ANGER, LOVE, PROTECT: imagine same as above except with my own health issues
    * LOGIC: imagine how my actions can butterfly effect to decrease suffering - it could happen in so many different ways (but gotta be careful of the opposite too)
    * LOGIC: "they have nowhere to turn to. they try to connect with others and get rejected" - i know things can be built to fix this - so this motivates the shiz out of me - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PCtpYTiyoP0
    * ACTION: play video games until burnt out (idk why this works but does)
    * STRENGTH, POWER: scenes in Dragonball when Goku and Krilin are training with Master Roshi
    * ANGER, LOVE, PROTECT: feeling need to protect. it's rare for me to feel this from irl stuff - but art in form of shows/movies defs makes me feel it. Can use that same feelings irl for motivation - most likely motivated to protect against bad futures or bad NOWs - and enable more good living
