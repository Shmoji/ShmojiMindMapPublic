  * what is it?
    * DL ACCELERATION LIBRARY: a deep learning GPU acceleration library based on CUDA. Only with it can deep learning calculations be completed on the GPU
      * just to clarify: To run a deep neural network on CUDA, you need to install cuDNN, just like you need to buy a wrench if you want to screw a nut. Only in this way can the GPU perform deep neural network work, which is much faster than the CPU.
