      * Around 9pm tonight started feeling muscle weakness in triceps, entire top of forearms, and tops of hands. I was just sitting at desk coding. I did stop mycopul yesterday

      * around 9pm felt chronic fatigue about 3-4/10. Some chronic muscle weakness in arms and general neck and back pain that is maybe irrelevant. So fatigued it was hard to go sit in chair to play games and when i did, i could barely game - was so slow and tired. Havent had chronic fatigue in a minute, so noteable. I ate Thai Star Pineapple fried rice which has onions and curry powder. My best guess all dis caused by dat meal

      * felt chronic fatigue 2-3/10 and very tired and hard to do anything around midday. Noticed stomach was extra gurgley around same time fatigue started. Also at same time brain fog was triggered. I feel slow and dumb
      * my best guess was caused by eating teriyaki meal last night and for lunch since it's only new thing
      * only other thing is that i think i clenched my jaw last night in sleep for first time in long time. Woke up to some small spasms that went away quickly too

      * first time with 2-3/10 chronic fatigue in quite a while. Feel it a lot in my forearms
      * only guesses for why: 1) chicken saag 2) went hard with calf raises (i dont think this is it tho) 3)i had intense dreams last night so maybe i clenched idk, i do remember waking up in night with increase in pain from when i went to sleep

      * around 8-9pm 3-6/10 tiredness kicked in. About 2-4/ chronic fatigue
      * i had to lay down, skip video games with bois, and couldnt even do anything. Just closed eyes rest of day
      * my best guess why: ate meditterasian dish chicken adobo that has garlic and onions - which are ingredents that i think tend to do this to me
