    * Student loans
      * I have $17,835.84 of student loans that I owe rn before interest has accrued
      * [x] I think Biden's new law will cover all my loans, but not sure yet. Check back here later and see [[TODO eventually - one day - dreams]]

    * [[Experimenting with Roam]]
      * I think I'm going to try this workflow: create pages using brackets. Then, type content inside that page itself. Then, if you want that content to also show up in daily notes, then copy block refs you want from certain page into daily notes and make them embeds. Any new day in the future, do I need to copy refs into new daily note (so that daily note changes also changes that certain page) or is there another way?
        * Why even need to write in daily notes for most things? Might as well just put a /embed of the thing you need for that day, but just shift click it and work directly in the page
        * Seems only time writing in daily notes is for more unstructured notes that are still linked to things. But most time will be spent in the specific pages themselves filling them out
      * This is a test. Today I am working on this page. Just shift click or regular click to work in it. Any unstructured notes, maybe still put in the daily note as Linked Ref: [[Ideamarket Backend]]

    * Experimenting with a precise schedule containing 3 BIG things to do during FREETIME
      * It feels like I always end a work session feeling like i didn't have enough time for it
        * This feeling makes me feel like i reallyyy want to work on the thing. Which is maybe good and incentivizing. But then not getting enough time again and again is such a bad feeling.
    * I'm going to experiment starting now. There's many things I want to do. I will choose 2 and stick with them. 1 other thing can try to stick with, but don't worry if can't. Whatever I am FEELING super pulled towards, I will do that one. If I don't feel pulled towards anything, I will go to scheduled approach and do whatever schedule says. If I realize i spent entire week on 1 thing, then make sure to get to stopping place and switch to new thing the next week
