  * what is it?
    * A type of chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed (so electrons are moved)
    * [[oxidation]] is the loss of electrons or an increase in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule.
    * [[reduction]] is the gain of electrons or a decrease in the oxidation state of an atom by another atom, an ion, or a molecule.
    * [[oxidant]] = causes other molecule to lose electrons and the oxidant gains those electrons (undergoes reduction)
    * [[reductant]] = causes other molecule to gain electrons and reductant loses electrons (undergoes oxidation)
    * Oxidation doesn't necessarily involve oxygen! Originally, the term was used when oxygen caused electron loss in a reaction. The modern definition is more general.
