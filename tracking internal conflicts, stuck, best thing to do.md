  * tracking trying to find the best thing to do in this moment or day, getting unstuck
    * [[2024-04-06]]
      * had somewhat an epiphany just now. was going through this and i was framing question as "what is the best thing i could be doing right now?" - which can be good sometimes and i think both are good - but that didnt resonate right now. That is wrong way to frame the question
      * what did resonate is: what will emerge naturally?
      * and i realized that part of me really didnt wanna work on my project right now. it wanted to play. so i decided today will be for play because it clearly wants to emerge
      * i know i made that amazing TODO list, but im noticing that when in this mood, i look at it and just feel blehhhh. like no.

      * i dont think i have much to say, but work in therapy between judger/productive parts and playful, creative and other parts is very related to this
      * after today's session: i posted this: one good way to resolve conflicts with different parts of yourself is to communicate intentions transparently and experiment. This is because of awesome experiment L mentioned where judger sits in discomfort of not knowing for 2 hours while playful part gets to gain confidence in guiding and playing for 2 hours at park - but playful or whichever part gives some knowing by giving an intention of time, place, thing beforehand ^D-yiO4piU

  * tracking conflicts of whether to post content on reg Shmoji or [[evil shmoji]]
    * [[2024-01-01]]
      * was uncertain where to post ending clip from [[Darker Than Black]], but posted to reg Shmoji even tho felt like content that would not add value - but then multiple people resonated and commented quickly. Im uncertain how to interpret this
      * this does feel like a one-off whereas the posting lyrics of stuff was consistently a non-value-add it seemed
      * it seems like it's nice having my side of me im proud of (is curated and adds value) separate from my side i 100% unconditionally love. They sometimes have union still tho. There's often times when i feel strong urge to bring stuff that has strong signal that it shouldnt be on regular Shmoji and put it right there on regular Shmoji - for example, aesthetics, preferences, emotions, or strong energies (maybe manifesting in all kinds of form like sharing frens al camino) - when that urge is high it's like i know i need to sneak it into my curated self
