  * **What is Nitric Oxide?**
    * What it does defines what it is
    * a colorless gas with the formula NO
    * Nitric oxide is a [[free radical]], meaning it has at least one unpaired valence electron, making it highly chemically reactive
    * **NO Synthesis**: the production of nitric oxide (NO) from **L-arginine** by a family of enzymes called Nitric oxide synthases
  * **What does it do?**
    * NO is an important cellular signaling molecule. It helps modulate vascular tone, insulin secretion, airway tone, and peristalsis, and is involved in angiogenesis and neural development. So...a ton of complex stuff
  * **Relates to me**
    * One of the main mechanisms of **endothelial dysfunction** is the diminishing of **nitric oxide**, often due to high levels of **asymmetric dimethylarginine**, which **interfere **with the normal **L-arginine-stimulated nitric oxide synthesis** and so leads to **hypertension**. The most prevailing mechanism of endothelial dysfunction is an increase in **reactive oxygen species**, which can impair nitric oxide production and activity via several mechanisms. (all tests show i have reactive oxygen species issues)
    * The **endothelium **of blood vessels uses **nitric oxide** to signal the surrounding smooth muscle to relax, resulting in vasodilation and **increasing **blood flow.
    * Nasal sinuses store nitric oxide. Long term depletion can lead to the cardiovascular plaque build-up, not good.** Nasal breathing** produces nitric oxide within the body, while oral breathing does not...*remembers my nasal issues*
    * **Vitamin D** caries out all its endothelial functions with nitric oxide as mediator. I'm low in Vitamin D last time i checked
    * The largest source of **nitrates **(and therefore nitric oxide) in the human diet is vegetables. **Beetroot **is the best of the bunch, with most research focusing on beetroot juice.
  * **What I can do to test this**
    * Eat beets or drink beet juice
    * Expose more skin to sun more often for Vitamin D
    * idk about this one: If safe, take L-arginine to produce more Nitric Oxide
