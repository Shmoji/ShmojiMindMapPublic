  * what are relationships
    * using example
      * your relationship to a tree ^hzMmTUdNV
        * Entirely decided by your STORY about the tree. In other words, story we tell about the tree is like a LENS through which we perceive the tree and relate to it.
        * There are a TON of different stories that allow us to relate to tree, but typically they come in 2 different flavors:
          * 1: tree is block of wood - renewable resource waiting to be harvested and used by man. Treats tree like a DEAD thing. Feels cold.
            * Parasitic relationship
          * 2: tree is a living breathing being that is fundamentally interconnected with all of life and is worthy of man's respect and service. Feels warm and treats tree like LIVING thing. 
            * Symbiotic/balanced relationship
  * how TOs
    * how to fix humanity's unbalanced relationships ^c0i2wLJtD
      * Much more complex than example of relationship with tree here: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/relationships#^hzMmTUdNV|your relationship to a tree]] - so we need to identify root cause of wrong relationship to solve general case. To do this, we need to ask ourselves what our relationship to STORY itself is. 
        * Is story a dead thing or living thing? Is it info tech invented by man for large scale coordination? Or is it a deeply mysterious sacred being which we co-create our reality with?
      * Replace social machine with a living machine. How to: ^0OODX5-wk
        * A system that integrates wisdom of the old (LIVING liminal tribes) and power of the new (DEAD social machine)
        * [[Project Liminality]] is the search for this new system
        * [[LOGOS]] = our dynamic relationship to story ^f4SoE5gk3
          * Consists of 3 distinct and non-interchangeable modalities:
          * 1: [[MonoLogos]]: our ability to draw symbols in sand to REPRESENT stories
          * 2: [[DiaLogos]]: the convo around the campfire itself
          * 3: [[InterLogos]]: dynamic flow between campfires - so who talks to whom about what. In a sense, this is given by the interplay of the 2 other modalities
        * So, we went from Dunbar number in tribes to billions of possible convo partners. Tech opened up huge landscape of possible InterLogos protocols (finding people for convo on different topics). We can further narrow down the search of Project Liminality by saying to find a system that has a future we must find the InterLogos that has a future. What might this InterLogos look like?:
          * example from ancient times:
            * the decision which campfire to join mediated by 2 factors:
              * 1: social connections with those present at campfire
              * 2: stories present at those campfires and curiosity they did or didnt evoke in travelers
          * Due to non-locality enabled by new tech - instead of letting stories steer the flow (of people?) from one place to another (like in ancient times) - we turn the story itself into a place. This is the new InterLogos. Implementing this based on PL video: ^cs6DzOfkZ
            * Define software object that represents the story - call this a MonoLogos node. Think of it as a portal to that story place. In order to visit that place you may hold that MonoLogos node in your liminal wallet. This can be thought of as a digital twin of the stories you hold in your interior/mind. 
            * So how to obtain a MonoLogos node?
              * 2 ways:
              * 1: create one yourself. Take inspiring story inside and create representation for it. Drag and drop that onto your wallet which will create a node with that motif. (can also add any metadata to this node)
            * You start out alone in this new story place. So how do you invite others to join?
              * Sharing story with them just like ancient people used to draw symbols in sand. You now put the MonoLogos node in the digital sand in the DiaLogos. Then your Logos partner receives it in their wallet and thus join you in that nonlocal place.
            * Trippy part: if you look at how these nonlocal story places interrelate, we can see that each story holds space for a number of people - a memetic tribe. And each member of tribe holds space for a number of stories which in turn holds space for other memetic tribes. So what emerges is a holographically interconnected fractal-like space - which means you can navigate to any part by zooming into any other part (stories or people) - let's call this liminal space.
            * PL can be thought of as a digital interface from physical space into liminal space. From local to non-local. From biosphere to noosphere.
            * Interface consists of 2 types of nodes:
            * 1: MonoLogos node - represents a story in monologos form (dead)
            * 2: DiaLogos node - represents a dialogos partner
            * All MonoLogos and DiaLogos nodes you hold will then self-organize through their InterLogos relations into a unique network we may call the Liminal Web
            * To navigate your Liminal Web: start at some MonoLogos node which will show all your social contexts that are in that space. Selecting a social context will show all MonoLogos nodes that you both have in common - so your shared vocab. If you find ML nodes that motivates you to discuss with others you can initiate a DiaLogos with any people of that place
            * The interface of DL has 3 main areas:
              * 1: your liminal wallet
              * 2: a video chat
              * 3: digital sand
            * You share ML nodes in convo. This expands each others horizon (and liminal web). This enables powerful peer-to-peer education system. There is special moment in education when someone shares a story with you that fits perfectly with some other story you hold and they both integrate into a higher order perspective. If that happens during a DL, you can combine the 2 or more ML nodes into a new ML node that transcends but includes all the input nodes with an added explanation of how all these pieces fit together. Most natural way to create explanation:
              * Record short clip of explaining it to your DL partner
            * If this happens, it activates the Coherence Beacon - which broadcasts the higher order node to all your friends holding either of the input nodes
              * Those who dont resonate with that synthesis will simply reject the higher order node and signal stops. Those who resonate with it will add it into their liminal wallet and thus extend the beacon to all of their friends. So this basically creates a social resonance filter that allows for truly meritocratic (merit of people instead of wealth or social status) reach and thus solves the virality problem (bad/dead stories taking spotlight - i assume). 
            * How to truly understand what's going on here: a member of memetic tribe discovers a more beautiful and coherent place and in turn invites his fellow tribe members living in either of these smaller story places to join him in this bigger place in which they all fit in together. Users of new system are memetic nomads.
            * This means intra-tribe (1 group - centralized) coherence is simultaneously serving inter-tribe (2 or more groups) coherence. This solves the need for Girardian scapegoating (conflict is resolved by uniting against an other who is excluded and blamed for all the chaos). My thought: i could still see adjacent stories blaming other adjacent stories for issues - so im uncertain about prior statement.
            * Consider recursive application of this process: all stories enhance memetic tribes - which will self-organize into a conveyor belt moving towards higher and higher coherence and syntropy. Call this syntropic flow - Liminal Flow
            * This liminal flow of increasing syntropy is moving towards collective intelligence - towards humanity becoming an authentic superorganism that creates the more beautiful world our heart knows is possible
  * relationships many may not think about
    * sacred relationship to story = LIMINALITY
      * story as a living being
        * This may be confusing how story could be living - i will try to explain
        * Example
          * In old days, we exchanged stories by meeting at campfire. Some people held dead stories and some held living stories.
          * In spirit of liminality (i guess this assumes meeting at campfire is that spirit?) we served these DEAD or LIVING beings by simply holding space for them to dialectically self-organize into more coherent versions of themselves.
          * For exceptional insights we would draw symbols in the sand and infuse them with the spirit of whatever story
          * Each tribe had multitude of campfires - members of tribe always going to and fro which was system that allowed all members to be in direct contact with each other thus enabling stories to flow through and shape collective with minimal RESISTANCE. In a meaningful way, this allowed the stories to incarnate in the collective as a social organism (in same way that story of cat incarnates as biological organism - atoms, bacteria, organs, etc)
          * Obvious problem - traveling distance causes TRIBES and info no get out. This translated into the well-known splitting phenomena of tribes around the Dunbar number of 150 to 500 people
          * Over time, tribes started innovating on our ability to create symbols. 1st major step was the abstraction of symbols into symbol systems like literacy and hieroglyphs which allowed for non-contextual transmission of stories (can read a text without encountering author).
          * 2nd major jump was long-distance tele-communication. Allowed non-contextual stories to be broadcast non-locally.
          * These new jumps allowed new system for maintaining coherence with tribe to emerge. One where a small elite would distribute stories in centralized manner to the masses. This was the birth of "the Social Machine" - a DEAD story that quickly came to dominate our planet.
          * You can see in social machine that SIZE of tribe is MUCH greater, but interconnectedness has greatly decreased (everyone is looking at the centralized stories). Social machine is much bigger than any social organism, but also much shallower. Also, noticed our IMPLICIT parasitic relationship with stories - the way they're used in this context like an info tech for large-scale coordination - eerily similar to computer code (centralized stories) programming drones (us). 
          * This system worked for limited time in sense that it maintained itself. As democratization of broadcast capacity hit climax and intro of internet, this system is dying into multi-polar narrative warfare for attention and influence. This is basically mass hypnosis causing a mass psychosis. This is existential threat.
          * So, in order to have future as species, we need to discover way of relating to stories that has a future. This system is talked of here: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/relationships#^0OODX5-wk|Replace social machine with a living machine.

  * story in relation to relationships
    * generally you have DEAD stories and ALIVE stories
    * stories are a combination of controllable and uncontrollable pieces of info (you can CHOOSE to modify any of the info, but not ideal to modify uncontrollable info to benefit self if it moves away from truth)
  * examples of relationships i like
    * their banter here is amazing lol. Like not considering my feelings type humor https://youtu.be/YrJtEOhHuXI
  * questions
    * are there times when it is ideal for your relationship with some thing to be a DEAD story or should you make as many stories alive as possible?
