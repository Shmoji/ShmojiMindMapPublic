    * [[2024-11-07]] prediction market basics and first questions #[[fast memo]]
      * MARKET = PAIRED YES vs NO: for most prediction markets, a market seems to be binary yes vs no that are paired
      * you either buy yes shares or no shares (yes and no are part of same market, not separate) - which are priced relative to each other. if yes is 0.25 cents, then no is 0.75 cents. You can think of these as percentages too. So $1 is max and so is 100% (for each $x share you buy, it turns into a $1 share if you win)
      * the percentages basically tell you what the market thinks is chance for that. 0.20 on NO means 20% chance for NO (based on da market)
      * CONTRACT/share amount is important thing too
      * Q: wait...so how do you know how many shares you bought...
        * total USD invested / PRICE of 1 share when you invested
        * PRICE ITEMS: basically tells how many things/items you bought (things/items being contracts at specific price you bought at - price items)
        * **Example Analogy**: If you have **$100** and a single item costs **$5** (1 share is $5...so not in prediction market), you divide **100 by 5** to find out how many items you can buy (**100 รท 5 = 20 items**)
        * ex: Dividing **$500** (total investment) by **$0.58** (share price you bought at) tells you how many **$0.58 contracts** you can buy with your **$500** = 862
        * think of ?priced shares/contracts as THINGS/items and how many of those things/items do you get for total investment you put in - when wondering how many shares you get (and total moneyz you get if win)
      * Q: how is it calculated the money you make if you win?
        * TOTAL in end: urTotalShares * $1 ... so just adding dollar sign to urTotalShares
        * PROFIT: TOTAL - originalAmountInvested. EX: $862 - $500 = $362
      * Q: what happens if you lose?
        * you lose ALL money invested yeeet
      * HOW IT WORK BEHIND SCENES: someone asks a question: "A or B?". you can only buy xAmount A if someone else buys mappedRatio yAmount B and what the two of you pay together adds up to $1 - that $1 goes to whoever of the two of you was correct. Prediction markets handle this behind the scene with incentives so you never have to worry about NOT having someone buying the other mappedRatio and your order not going through
      * Q: what is a parlay?
        * meme: legs baby legs
        * basically an AND operator bet lol
        * a combo of multiple events/bets into ONE wager/bet. to WIN, every single bet/leg in parlay must win. if even 1 of many fails, then you no get anything boii
        * offers potential for BIGGG returns vs placing solo bets on each event separately, due to the increased RISK of all events needing to win for the parlay to succeed.
