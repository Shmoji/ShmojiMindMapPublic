  * what is it?
    * ME:
      * you have some object. that object has a local space and global space. When local manifold is similar enough to tangent spaces all around, then it is differentiable and calc can be performed to get all kinds of info.
      * The higher dimensional space can effect whether lower dimension space is easily differentiable or not
    * a type of manifold that is locally similar enough to a vector space to allow one to apply [[calculus]]. Being able to apply calc allows you to figure out all kinds of crap
      * so is the vector space being talked about in that sentence a higher dimension than the local space?
        * AI: 
          * No, in the context of the sentence, the "vector space" being referred to is not necessarily of a higher dimension than the local space. Let's clarify this:
          * In the context of a manifold being "locally similar enough to a vector space to allow one to apply calculus," the vector space being mentioned is specifically the tangent space to the manifold at a particular point. The tangent space is an important concept in differential geometry and plays a crucial role in understanding the local behavior of the manifold.
          * When we say the manifold is "locally similar enough to a vector space," we mean that at each point on the manifold, there exists a tangent space that behaves like a vector space. The tangent space is a flat vector space that is intrinsically associated with the manifold at that particular point. It has the same dimension as the manifold itself.
          * In a tangent space, you can think of it as a local approximation to the manifold at that point. It's like zooming in on the manifold so closely that it looks like a flat space (a vector space) around that point. This allows us to apply calculus on the tangent space, just as we would on a flat space, and perform operations like taking derivatives and calculating rates of change.
          * So, to summarize, the vector space being talked about in that sentence is the tangent space, which is a local approximation to the manifold at a specific point and has the same dimension as the manifold itself. It is not a higher dimension; it is specifically tailored to match the local behavior of the manifold.
    * AI on key points:
      * Local Euclidean structure: A differential manifold looks like Euclidean space (flat space) when you zoom in enough around any point. It means that at every point on the manifold, you can find a small region that closely resembles an ordinary flat space.
      * Global Curved Structure: Despite the local Euclidean appearance, the manifold can have a more complex global shape. Think of a curved surface like a sphere or a torus. It can be bent, twisted, or have other intricate geometric properties.
      * Coordinate Systems (Charts): To handle the curved nature of the manifold, we use special coordinate systems called "charts." Each chart maps a portion of the manifold to a region in an ordinary Euclidean space (like a flat plane). Within that region, the coordinate system allows us to describe points and perform calculus as we do in flat space.
      * Smoothness and Compatibility: The coordinate systems (charts) must be smooth, meaning they allow for differentiation and integration of functions. Moreover, these charts should be compatible with each other where they overlap. Smooth compatibility ensures that the transition from one chart to another is seamless and well-defined.
      * Smooth Functions and Calculus: With the smooth charts, we can perform calculus on the manifold. This includes defining tangent vectors (vectors at each point on the manifold), derivatives (rates of change of functions), and integrals (area/volume calculations) on the manifold.
      * Applications: Differential manifolds have broad applications in various fields, such as physics (e.g., general relativity), engineering (e.g., robotics and control theory), computer graphics, and more. They provide a powerful framework for understanding and modeling complex spaces and systems.
  * questions
    * what would nondifferentiable manifold be then?
      * AI: A non-differentiable manifold is a mathematical space where it is not possible to define smooth coordinate systems (charts) covering the entire manifold. In other words, it lacks the smoothness property that is a fundamental requirement for differential manifolds.

In a differential manifold, the smoothness of coordinate charts ensures that the transition from one chart to another is well-behaved, and we can consistently perform calculus on the manifold. However, in a non-differentiable manifold, there are regions where the coordinate systems cannot be smoothly patched together, making it impossible to define smooth functions and perform calculus throughout the entire space.

Non-differentiable manifolds are typically more exotic and less common than differential manifolds. They can have various types of singularities, discontinuities, or topological obstructions that prevent the existence of smooth coordinate systems.

A well-known example of a non-differentiable manifold is the "topologist's sine curve." It's a curve in 2-dimensional space that has a lot of "kinks," making it non-differentiable at certain points. Another example is the "wild knot," which is a knot in 3-dimensional space with wild, non-differentiable behavior.

While non-differentiable manifolds may seem more abstract and challenging to work with, they are essential in certain areas of mathematics, such as topology and singularity theory, where understanding irregular or pathological spaces is crucial. However, in most practical applications, we often deal with differential manifolds, where smoothness allows for a more accessible and well-behaved mathematical framework.
    * can you use different manifolds on a higher dimensional structure in order to find one that is differentiable? for example, you have a weird sphere with lumps. Some 2D manifolds on the surface of that sphere are differentiable and some are not? is this thinking correct?
      * AI:
        * Yes, your thinking is correct! On a higher-dimensional structure like a curved sphere, you can find different 2D manifolds (surfaces) that may have differentiable properties or not.
        * Let's break it down step by step:
          * Higher-Dimensional Structure: Imagine you have a three-dimensional curved object, like a sphere with lumps or bumps on its surface. This three-dimensional space is a manifold itself, as it is a geometric object that we can study mathematically.
          * 2D Manifolds on the Surface: Now, on the surface of this three-dimensional object, you can consider 2D manifolds. A 2D manifold is a surface that lies entirely within the three-dimensional object. For example, a flat disc on the surface of the sphere would be a 2D manifold.
          * Differentiability of 2D Manifolds: The smoothness or differentiability of these 2D manifolds can vary. Some 2D manifolds on the surface of the sphere may be smooth (differentiable) without any lumps or singularities. These smooth 2D manifolds can be thought of as flat regions on the curved surface.
          * Non-Differentiable 2D Manifolds: However, you can also have 2D manifolds that are not smooth and have lumps, singularities, or sharp bends on the curved surface. These non-differentiable 2D manifolds may have points where the surface is not well-behaved, making it impossible to define smooth coordinate systems.
          * Importance of Tangent Space: Remember, differentiability is about whether we can smoothly define coordinate systems and perform calculus on the manifold. In areas where the 2D manifold has bumps, singularities, or other irregularities, the tangent space (the local approximation of the manifold) may not behave like a flat vector space, leading to non-differentiability.
        * In summary, on a higher-dimensional curved object (like a sphere with lumps), you can indeed find different 2D manifolds on its surface. Some of these 2D manifolds will be smooth (differentiable) and behave like flat spaces, while others may have irregularities that make them non-differentiable. The concept of differentiability applies locally, and the presence of lumps, bumps, or other singularities can affect the differentiability of specific 2D manifolds on the curved surface.
