    * i think i feel bad (Fi) when i dont add value. So i think this is my mind wants my actions to converge on something that adds value. About converging. Seems i want to converge, which is some trait, right? Based on notes below, i think im closer to IP? Bc i will actively seek good food, but then struggle to experience it in way that meets expectations. Same with adding value at work. I definitely seek either way. #finding-my-mbti-type
      * Random notes on convergence: 
        * EJs actively seek and readily experience closure
        * EPs neither strongly seek nor readily experience closure
        * IJs experience, but do not strongly seek, closure
        * IPs seek, but do not readily experience, closure
