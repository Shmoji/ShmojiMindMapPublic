    * For first time in while, woke up with very itchy dandruff head. Think due to all sweets yesterday causing angy candida

    * Kidney: ate a bunch of sweet potato today and few hours later, my right kidney was hurting 6/10. definitely an oxalates thing
  * [[TODO soon]]
    * [x] Get coconut oil and try doing oil pulling explained here https://www.thecandidadiet.com/unusual-effective-treatment-oral-thrush/
    * [x] Delete all chrome and brave extensions 
  * [[Shmoji Journal]]
    * STREAMING: i noticed with games that have lots of reading, i prefer to mostly read in my head and say fun stuff or whatever is interesting to my mind. Sometimes i like to read entire lines when they're unique or a character with a fun voice to do

    * Emotions: hung out with some friends haven't seen in like a year and feel weird af after. everyone is growing and maturing and i wish i could hear all the little details about everyone's life, but just not enough time. 
    * late at night and my tum is killing me. Did just oxalates from sweet potato do that? it obviously did kidney pain, but this feels like upset tummy.
