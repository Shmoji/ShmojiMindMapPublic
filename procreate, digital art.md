      * plus button and top right add button to make custom canvas
        * width of 4320 and height of 5400
        * when you export this canvas at 25% or 1/4 of OG size, you get 1080 x 1350 which is exact instagram image size
        * 300 DPI (just in case you want this to ever be on physical item)
        * Color profile > sRGB IEC6 1966-2.1

    * what are some processes for creating digital art?
      * SamDoesArt:
        * found photo that resonates in some way while scrolling internet
        * made a ROUGH sketch of photo - does not need much detail - he said he does it so he knows where all colors are gonna go
        * color blocking: used to get overall sense of color/lighting/mood of painting - very rough, not lot of detail. Likes to color block bg first bc gives idea if painting is gonna work before moving on to the subject
          * color blocking seems to just be roughly defining the subject in the environment using colors inside the sketch outline
        * once bg figured out, can turn opacity down on OG sketch and use lasso tool to get outline of character or subjects. This is so when doing color blocking for subjects, you dont go outside the outline. Dont have to do this, but just makes things easier
        * flip canvas occasionally to find mistakes
        * goes into more details with smaller brush once rough color blocking starts to define character/subject in environment
      * SamDoesArt and me adding stuff:
        * what is your subject? what is the environment?
        * start as abstract as possible. outlines. sketches. dont do details too early
    * procreate-specific questions
      * how to draw perfect circle
        * draw circle, hold at end - this gives ellipse - then hold one other finger to make perfect circle (this works with triangle and squares too)
      * how to FILL with color
        * can color drop or the other way lol
        * with color drop, you can drag to spot and not let go and it will fill and then you can decide on color threshhold to fill gaps or to fit inside if bleeding through
      * how to bring current brush to eraser
        * tap and hold eraser
      * what is alpha lock?
        * you can only draw where there is paint - not on any transparent areas
      * what are clipping masks?
        * create layer over other layer (like one that has circle)
        * tap new layer to turn to clipping mask
        * now it takes on shape of all paint in layer below
      * how to get help or guides for your drawings
        * action menu > edit drawing guide - youll see grid to help with 2d stuff like flat designs like floor designs, isometric can bring drawings into 3rd dimension like technical drawings, perspective which lets you tap to add vanishing points to create more realistic art for 3d scenes, and symmetry which is like mirror modifier but has many diff modes
