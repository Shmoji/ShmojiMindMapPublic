        * last night i woke up around 1-3am and just couldnt go back to sleep. insanely rare for me to struggle with sleep
        * possible reasons why: 1) concern over frens mental health after call 2) day 2 of taking [[colostrum]] 3) something else ^QOn9CGZRb
        * had big amount of nose popping last night during bad sleep ^ENZ92-MhY ^wNMxS3T-Z

        * basically had exact same as [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/symptom- bad sleep#^Eqrij_oVa|February 25th, 2024]] for first time since then
        * possible reasons why: 1) few days into taking San Ren Tang now 2) Debbie died yesterday 3) i put 2 week notice in yesterday which was hard af 4) ate grilled chicken Pho which had bean sprouts, cucumbers, some mix of soup, and onions - i think there's a ton of onions which could be the cause of issues 5) i ate too many chocolates too late in afternoon and caffeine OD lol 6) acupuncture treatments are under way - which is similar to point 1 ^rZnJxZIsU

        * yesterday i drank juice of pears in jar from C which is basically pure sugar. instantly my stomach started hurting. i woke up a million times in night and each time i could not get back to sleep and i was having ear pulse issue
        * pretty sure caused by sugar intake. my coil for my braces also just came off yesterday, so that's a possible cause, but im p sure it's the sugar

        * woke up like a million times in sleep last night. i always instantly went back to sleep tho. no pulsing in ears or other symptoms
        * ideas why: 1) had late night banana/milk smoothie and it was a lot...enough to bloat me 2) lunch i had corn, mashed potatoes n gravy, cod liver 3) at lunch had usual chocos moderate amount
    * [[2025-03-05]]
        * i laid there for hours and hours without sleeping at all
        * possible reasons: 1) cod liver for din (i doubt it but maybe) 2) just finished first whyspia blog and was quite excited 3) had coffee around 2-3 (doubt it, done this plenty of times and got sleep)
    * [[2025-06-12]]
        * Woke multiple times in the night and each time was waking from pretty intense nightmare. Only idea: ate tonnnnn of meatballs in new meatball sotanghon. Do not know the type of meatball, but looked like it had other ingredients like spices and veggies tbh. so my main idea/guess for cause of nightmares and not being able to sleep: BEEF
        * nightmare 1: force to military thing during vacation in mountains by d. nightmare 2: all my teeth just dislodged in my mouth with braces all tangled - in dream the reason for not being able to sleep irl was because of THIS - somehow i didnt even know. My guess why: that night was trying to process terror of tooth infection hell of childhood.
