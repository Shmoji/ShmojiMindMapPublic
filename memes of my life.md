  * TODO: maybe tie each of these to an ai chat
  * list
    * FLIGHT TO FRANCE: how to get it cheapest, but easiest, and also safest
        * brainstorming
            * rn i only know of 3 options:
            * 1) RDU to BOD for about $1000
            * 2) ILM to BOD for about $1000
            * 3) ILM to JFK (1 ticket) and then JFK to BOD (1 ticket). Not connected flights so lots of risks. Can i get there v early just in case of delays??? Then am i cool just waiting if super early?? What is max delay that could happen?? (maybe 4H) How long does customs take once get to JFK? (maybe 2-3H)
            * other things to consider when getting DEPARTING flight:
            * 1) what time do i get to BOD? after getting there i need time to take train to Bergerac. Can i buy that train ticket once i get there? or does need to be ahead of time?
            * other things to consider when getting RETURNING flight:
            * 1) does my flight out of BOD allow me time to take train from Bergerac to BOD? research: you would take train from Bergerac to Bordeaux Saint-Jean station (1H30M) and then need to take 30Direct Airport Shuttle from that station to BOD (30M)
            * 2) am i getting back to Wilmington at time that allows someone to pick me up...so not midnight (this assumes i get back to ILM) 
    * POSTPONED: apply to Japanese Language School
        * schools im looking at now
            * Tokyo Central Japanese Lang School
            * Shibuya Gaigo Gakuin
    * WHAT is PRiORiTY?
        * resolved on: 
      * brainstorming
        * VPS (linode?) for whyspia and then quickly get data storage and encryption good before Vibecamp
        * WHYSPIA x VIBECAMP: whyspia Vibecamp idea completely planned out. AND apply to VC grant for it
          * brainstorming
          * resolved on
            * physical nonquiet space
              * whyspia welcome center (maybe welcome to whyspia sign)
              * here we operate 1) alignment and connection board 2) quest board 3) place to view all Vibecamp events in person maybe??
              * ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTION BOARD (maybe this is the first sign seen??)
                * a sign saying "what do you explicitly want to share with others to increase chances of alignment and connection" and then give these examples:
                * DESIRES/HELP: what do you want or what do you need help with that could be shared to increase the chances you get what you want or get help
                * WANT_YOU_TO_KNOW_TAGS: these are lil signals of things you explicitly want others to know, but not necessarily a STRONG desire or something you need help with. Maybe you dont necessarily want to create an entire event, but you want to talk about a niche topic - you can mention this here and maybe a connection could happen!
                * sign and QR code for people to add and track posts in the app
                * PLACE (only on app)
                * STATUS (only on app)
              * QUEST BOARD - give and take quests!
                * sign and QR code for people to add and track quests in the app
                * CATEGORIES people can tag on their quest
                  * quest with rewards vs no rewards
                  * quest for infinite questers vs a fixed number of questers vs just one quester 
                * brainstorming
                  * maybe just have a board and way for people to write quest and stick to board
                  * maybe i recommend people add info about the above categories so other people know
                  * if more categorizing needed...maybe i can bring folders...or containers you can put stuff in?? (helppp i need advice here)
            * physical quiet space
        * whyspia event i can hold in Tokyo BEFORE I LEAVE
    * WHAT RESONATES THE MOST THAT I WANT TO SHARE? BEAUTIFUL STUFF, EVOKED FEELS, VIBES, ETC. Maybe what is most alive for me. In my heart.
        * NOTE: imagine what i would randomly bring up to Tyler if i joined party for first time in a while...like fumetsunoanatahe or Japanese konbinis or style in Japan
