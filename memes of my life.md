      * progress
        * [[2025-04-09]] started process by reaching out to Shibuya Startup Support. Gotta wait for them to reach out to me now
        * [[2025-04-14]] ball back in my court. Do i have all the documents they need?
        * [[2025-04-15]] okay, i think im gonna postpone this until im back in USA. BUT i will still work on the docs if i have time. i think making pitch deck could be quite valuable when spaced out and not just doing gay shit like that 24/7 (i just finished several grant apps which are basically business plans)

      * brainstorming
        * VPS (linode?) for whyspia and then quickly get data storage and encryption good before Vibecamp
        * WHYSPIA x VIBECAMP: whyspia Vibecamp idea completely planned out. AND apply to VC grant for it
          * brainstorming
          * resolved on
            * physical nonquiet space
              * whyspia welcome center (maybe welcome to whyspia sign)
              * here we operate 1) alignment and connection board 2) quest board 3) place to view all Vibecamp events in person maybe??
              * ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTION BOARD (maybe this is the first sign seen??)
                * a sign saying "what do you explicitly want to share with others to increase chances of alignment and connection" and then give these examples:
                * DESIRES/HELP: what do you want or what do you need help with that could be shared to increase the chances you get what you want or get help
                * WANT_YOU_TO_KNOW_TAGS: these are lil signals of things you explicitly want others to know, but not necessarily a STRONG desire or something you need help with. Maybe you dont necessarily want to create an entire event, but you want to talk about a niche topic - you can mention this here and maybe a connection could happen!
                * sign and QR code for people to add and track posts in the app
                * PLACE (only on app)

                  * quest with rewards vs no rewards
                  * quest for infinite questers vs a fixed number of questers vs just one quester 
                * brainstorming
                  * maybe just have a board and way for people to write quest and stick to board
                  * maybe i recommend people add info about the above categories so other people know
                  * if more categorizing needed...maybe i can bring folders...or containers you can put stuff in?? (helppp i need advice here)
            * physical quiet space
        * whyspia event i can hold in Tokyo BEFORE I LEAVE
    * WHAT RESONATES THE MOST THAT I WANT TO SHARE? BEAUTIFUL STUFF, EVOKED FEELS, VIBES, ETC. Maybe what is most alive for me. In my heart.
      * NOTE: imagine what i would randomly bring up to Tyler if i joined party for first time in a while...like fumetsunoanatahe or Japanese konbinis or style in Japan
