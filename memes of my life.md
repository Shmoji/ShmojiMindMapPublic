	    * FLIGHT TO FRANCE: how to get it cheapest, but easiest, and also safest
	        * brainstorming
	            * other things to consider when getting DEPARTING flight:
	            * 1) what time do i get to BOD? after getting there i need time to take train to Bergerac. Can i buy that train ticket once i get there? or does need to be ahead of time?
	            * other things to consider when getting RETURNING flight:
	            * 1) does my flight out of BOD allow me time to take train from Bergerac to BOD? research: you would take train from Bergerac to Bordeaux Saint-Jean station (1H30M) and then need to take 30Direct Airport Shuttle from that station to BOD (30M)
	            * 2) am i getting back to Wilmington at time that allows someone to pick me up...so not midnight (this assumes i get back to ILM)
