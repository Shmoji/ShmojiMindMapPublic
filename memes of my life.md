        * resolved on: 
      * brainstorming
        * VPS (linode?) for whyspia and then quickly get data storage and encryption good before Vibecamp
        * WHYSPIA x VIBECAMP: whyspia Vibecamp idea completely planned out. AND apply to VC grant for it
          * brainstorming
          * resolved on
            * physical nonquiet space
              * whyspia welcome center (maybe welcome to whyspia sign)
              * here we operate 1) alignment and connection board 2) quest board 3) place to view all Vibecamp events in person maybe??
              * ALIGNMENT AND CONNECTION BOARD (maybe this is the first sign seen??)
                * a sign saying "what do you explicitly want to share with others to increase chances of alignment and connection" and then give these examples:
                * DESIRES/HELP: what do you want or what do you need help with that could be shared to increase the chances you get what you want or get help
                * WANT_YOU_TO_KNOW_TAGS: these are lil signals of things you explicitly want others to know, but not necessarily a STRONG desire or something you need help with. Maybe you dont necessarily want to create an entire event, but you want to talk about a niche topic - you can mention this here and maybe a connection could happen!
                * sign and QR code for people to add and track posts in the app

                  * quest for infinite questers vs a fixed number of questers vs just one quester 
                * brainstorming
                  * maybe just have a board and way for people to write quest and stick to board
                  * maybe i recommend people add info about the above categories so other people know
                  * if more categorizing needed...maybe i can bring folders...or containers you can put stuff in?? (helppp i need advice here)
            * physical quiet space
        * whyspia event i can hold in Tokyo BEFORE I LEAVE
