	    * research professors and their research at Tokyo unis - make sure they have research student program tho. Apparently dont contact them
		    * how to find
			    * imo may be good to start by just finding the research student programs
			    * find degree programs in tokyo taught in english
			    * make list of unis that offer that degree program
			    * look at departments website for list of professors and their research specialization. Proceed based on their ongoing research. Make list of these professors and their research
			    *  If you have more than 3-4 professors/universities on your list, contact the department (_not the professor_) and ask two things: “Based on my previous academic background, do I qualify for admission to this degree program at your university? I am interested in potentially working with X professor, could you please check and confirm whether or not they are accepting new students in their lab to supervise for the 2027-28 academic year?” You can let them know that it is against MEXT’s guidance to applicants for you to contact the professor directly at this time.

		        * Application period for 2027 is April-May 2026
		        * if applying for research spot that requires Japanese, there is a mid-June 2026 exam period - with online options. Dont need if research spot is totally in English.

		        * Researching and finding a professor/advisor looks really good, but not necessarily needed
