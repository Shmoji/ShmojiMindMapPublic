	- specifically the pain that feels like where my rib bones are weird are hurting. Like stomach lining is swollen or inflamed or something. 2-4/10 umcomfy and pain. Pain reduced with certain sitting positions
	- exact same as the drainage issue: really didn't have it much today until after dinner. My guess: the yogurt i ate. But just in case, i also had sukiya chicken bowl with whatever veggies it has.
