  * My Workout Schedule
    * Jog 30-75 minutes at zone 2 (you can sustain convo, but if you push any harder, then cannot sustain). Pure nasal breathing
    * Run 30-35 minutes (more than zone 2, but not all out sprint). Cannot sustain nasal breathing entire time
      * Hits MANY different areas of endurance
    * Run as intense as possible. 
      * Two ways to do this one:
        * 1) Airdyne Bike. (fan, feet, arms)
          * 20-30 secs all-out sprint using arms/legs and then 10 second rest. Repeat. Do it for 8-12 rounds (will prob already hit max heart rate at round 5)
        * 2) Sprint jog intervals
          * Sprint for 20-30 secs and then jog for 10 seconds. Repeat
      * HIIT - high intensity interval training
        * This can tap into strength and hypertrophy increases for legs
        * Builds slow-twitch muscles fibers, boosting mitochondrial effeciancy and quantity.
        * Boosts heart health by stretching the fibers and forcing them to be more adaptable and makes the lungs more efficient at replacing oxygen in the blood
      * This is 2nd leg workout of week
      * WARNING: can get injured very easily. Huberman tends to go 95% just in case. Airdyne is safer he said than sprinting.
      * Protein synthesis in muscle group can be stimulated about every 42-72 hours (why you should wait a while after leg day to do this)
    * Chest and abs once per week
      * Chest
        * chest journal

            * hard to tell if im actually getting a workout from this or not. i know you dont want to overdo neck workouts anyways.
          * [[2023-10-03]]
            * Tried again and i dont think this workout is good. I need to research another one 
        * Do these workouts: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWKMy4BETQM
        * Set 1: Yesses (do additional set if you want)
          * Lay on back and let head fall back. Top of head should point towards floor. Bring chin to chest and give self double chin.
          * This works flexors 
        * Set 2: Nos (do additional set if you want)
          * Eyes should be looking straight at ceiling. Go right, mid, left, and so on
          * This works flexors and rotators
        * Set 3: Maybes (do additional if you want)
          * Lay head like Yesses, but then bring right ear to right shoulder. Then, left ear to left shoulder
          * These include side flexion
        * Next sets: do same except on your stomach instead of back
          * This is extension instead of flexion while laying on back (works extensor muscles)
      * Back
        * this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z_k8p36Fek
        * journal on this exercise
          * felt like i couldnt do the straight arm pulldown bc my sheets arent long enough
          * i know it's gonna be hard to do this again unless i study it and write it down - so hopefully i'll get to that
          * [[2023-10-17]]
            * i removed set 3 because i just wasnt getting a workout from it. This is my 3rd time trying it across a month
            * felt like after prone arm circles, i could sit up straight criss cross on floor without pain. Didnt really feel that after other workouts

        * Workout 1
          * set 1 - bodyweight lat pulldowns
            * wrap sheets around hands
            * lay on floor with legs straight OR bend knees so v small angle and when going up it becomes 90 degree angle knees
            * start with arms straight upward at 45 degrees and palms mostly looking towards ground
            * pull elbows down to lift body up and keep elbows close to body
          * set 2 - bodyweight row (mid traps which is upper back and some shoulders, rhomboids)
            * grab sheets, take few steps back, lean back until tension in sheets
            * movement seems about same as set 1 exercise
          * set 4 - bed sheet face pulls (mid back, back shoulders, top shoulders)- important for posture
            * same as set 2, except you rotate shoulder into a bicep flex
            * keep elbows high
            * pull hands towards face instead of away from face
          * set 5 - prone arm circles (hits upper back and lower back)
            * on tummy. arms straight up. palms facing down. feet hip width apart.
            * raise arms and legs
            * bring arms around body until palms face up
            * can lower limbs back down before next rep
      * Stretches
        * L-shaped arms and back to wall
          * I really feel this one during it. Don't typically feel it next day though
          * I literally just hold in that position and try to get back of hands to touch wall as long as possible
  * My exercise progress this week
    * [ ] Leg workout
    * [x] Jogged zone 2 30-75 minutes
    * [ ] Ran zone 3 30-35 minutes
    * [ ] Ran HIIT
    * [ ] Chest and abs
    * [x] Neck, back, biceps (if time), and stretches (if time)
  * What i am sure of
    * I want to be able to workout almost anywhere without needing to go to some gym. So calisthenics are good.
  * Good resources for best workouts for longevity
    * ![](https://twitter.com/hubermanlab/status/1584198119083810816)

  * Things that are good
    * Get 180-200 minutes of zone 2 cardio per week
    * Get up to max heart rate at least once per week
  * Questions
    * What is my max heart rate?
      * Take the number 220 - AGE = MHR. So mine is 195
    * how are you supposed to breathe during a workout? what about an ab workout that you just hold muscles tight for?
      * GPT4: As a general rule, exhale during the hardest part of the exercise (muscle flex/contract) and inhale during the easier part (muscle loosen).
      * for workouts you hold - like a plank - you want to breathe, but do it shallowly. Start with big breathe before exercise. Do not hold breath.
  * Brainstorming what exercises are best for me
    * My back pain distracts me daily. Maybe exercises to fix that are worth it.
