      * i dont like trading in morning bc it's almost always super volatile. Makes hesitant to act. Also gas fees go way high.

      * fees and markets are down so i was gonna invest into OCEAN. Tried on regular coinbase and their fee was $200. Same for buying any other crypto. Fuck that. So i was gonna used Advanced Trading on Coinbase bc that makes so CB fees arent retarded - but only way to pay for advanced trades is using USD cash or USDC - only way to get those goes through $200 CB fee or Bank Wire or straight from bank which then goes on hold for multiple days - but for some reason using VISA for your bank doesnt go on hold - but cant get USD cash with that. My wording here sucks i know, but im pissed.
      * trading is friggin hard. I realized i could deposit from bank into CEX ocean to buy low - i just cant send it until ACH wait time over - which is fine. I accidentally did limit order and was stressful. I cancelled and did market order instead which was instant. Used advanced trading of course and fee much better - it was $27.

      * in my last note i said waiting for ACH was fine - that shit still hasnt finished so im uncertain if it's fine. I was able to buy low bc of it, but my money has been stuck on CEX for a long ass time which is not right
