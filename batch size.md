    * The batch size is a hyperparameter that defines the number of samples to work through before updating the internal model parameters.
    * The batch size is a number of samples processed before the model is updated. Batch size is smaller than epoch since iterating over samples. Sample is piece of batch and batch is piece of epoch.
    * The number of epochs is the number of complete passes through the training dataset.
