  * paths for this curious playful part figuring this shit out
    * using VM of mac so i can work with deving a ios app and use and inspect subconscious to understand how it then connects to Noosphere
    * getting orb working in same way that they did in that YT video of syncing data across devices. Then understand how that cli tool works and connects to Noosphere
      * i want to build a literal app, so maybe this is further away from what i want bc it is cli tool?
      * but also, i think this is typescript app hooked to noosphere, whereas subconscious is swift - idgaf about apple and i use TS
      * another downside: apparently orb (TS version of noosphere API) is far behind rust version
    * understand core rust Noosphere APIs directly...but how?
      * i feel this would be easy to get stuck just learning their code and not aligned with me building app on top of Noosphere. Feel their code needs to meet me in the middle so i can figure out how to use it
      * ive read through a lot of the code but i start getting into the details and i feel like "wait a second! these details arent even related to how i want to use noosphere!"
      * realization: i think orb is actually just the Noosphere CLI - not necessarily the TS version
