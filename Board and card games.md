  * Azul

    * Game ends when round ends and someone has 1 full horizontal row

    * Round ends once all pieces taken from middle
    * Your turn

      * Can only take 1 pattern and must take ALL of that pattern. If taken from circle, other pieces go to middle. If taken from middle, must take the -1 piece if there. It let's you go first next round, but is also -1 point. 
    * Scoring

      * If L, you score the common piece 2 times. 
      * Full column is +7, full row is +2
      * I don't understand the +10
      * On new round done, you only score based on new tiles added

    * Strategy
      * Try to get as many pieces adjacent. So as many t's or L's as possible.
      * Try to get as many vertical fills as possible. Horizontal too, but they give less points
      * Too many pieces on the left row actually make u lose points, so careful
