  * what is it?
    * me: seems like different charges bringing molecules together. Water molecules attract each other because opposites attract. But the air around the water doesnt have that much charged particles so water molecules isnt pulled towards the air - except in rare scenarios when big electromagnetic force can sometimes observe water bend towards the charged thing
