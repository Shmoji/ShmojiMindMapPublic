  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Last night i started Magnesium Glycinate at night to replace Magnesium chloride at night. Im now taking atleast 100mg more Mag than i was taking previously for my nighttime dose. Woke up in night with some lower stomach/bladder pain at about 5/10. In morning i did a lot of pooping lol. Then at lunch did even more. So my guess is that since i increased my Mag intake, it is soaking up lots of water into gut and digested food and making poop come out. Im almost always constipated, but maybe all i needed to do was increase mag intake to fix that.
