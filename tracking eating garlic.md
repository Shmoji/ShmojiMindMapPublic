      * few days ago had chicken adobo. the garlic cloves melt into the sauce. didnt really have any issues afterwards
      * altho: that night i had weird ear mucus that i can hear slide around when head sideways on pillow. Was first time having that in a few days or week
      * also had like 3 bochi which contains sugar and condensed milk (i think these hurt me if i exceed 3, but not sure if they cause mucus stuff)
