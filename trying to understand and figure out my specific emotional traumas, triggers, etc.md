  * NOTE: what this note is: in Body Keeps the Score many stories of individuals successfully processing traumas is told - each person had very specific things they processed - im trying to figure out what my specific things are - and i know for sure i have at least one - i feel it all the time
  * tracking thoughts
    * tracking random things that made me cry and idk why

        * i read the end of chapter 17 of Body Keeps the Score. The guy was processing stories of his past and had an image of himself alone in his room screaming. For some reason this part of the story is when i started tearing up. Also remember the therapist using IFS and the guy kep criticizing the crying boy he imagined that was him in past - and therapist would tell dude to tell that critic i appreciate you - can you step back? allows dude to return to grief/trauma
        * oh interesting, while going to pee, i randomly remembered vague memory that idek if is real - of getting a card while in class telling me my dad had left to go over seas. this made me cry for a split second. and then i feel the crying go away. idk if this is a natural short cry and that was it - or if some sort of manager is not backing away far enough to fully process and numbing my emotions.
        * after remembering the above, i remembered time when i didnt know if i wanted to go with mom or nana. basically some mixup between their plans. i was on way to hang with mom, but then plans changed and basically nvm. i remember crying. this didnt currently make me cry like remembering getting that card while in class
