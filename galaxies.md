  * list of galaxy clusters
    * CATEGORY: quiet galaxy clusters
      * SPT2215
        * all on its own. quiet. (which is rare bc most galaxy clusters are violently interacting - over long timescales of course)
        * contains 700 trillion times the mass of the Sun, but there's no evidence of any large-scale mergers or disruption in the last BILLION years
        * seen when the Universe was only 5.3 billion years old
  * list of galaxy groups
    * what are they?
      * they are like a galaxy cluster, but smaller. They often have many less galaxies in them
      * They get very mixed up with clusters so it's probably not that big a deal to mix them up - kind of annoying tho tbh
    * Local Group
      * Milky Way
      * Andromeda
      * Barnard's galaxy
  * list of interacting galaxies (so they arent 1 singular galaxy themselves)
    * ARP 273 - a Galactic Rose
      * 300 million light years away from us
      * UGC 1813 - smaller galaxy on bottom - the stem ^vZzCWsZk2
      * UGC 1810 - bigger galaxy on top - the rose. Is a ring galaxy. Companion galaxy may have past through to create the shape ^JnfD1NBiN
    * Arp-Madore 2105-332
      * 200 million light-years away from us
      * bunch of galaxies lined up in super friggin cool way from our POV. feel this description isnt enough to remember, but thaz all i have - it look kewl
