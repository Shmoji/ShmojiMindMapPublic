  * what insulin do?
    * regulates our body's response to sugar, but the effects can differ a lot between people
  * examples of how a single piece of candy can affect three people quite differently:
    * **Person A: Healthy Insulin Production & Response**
      * - **Blood Sugar Level**: After eating a piece of candy, Person A's blood sugar will rise. However, due to their healthy insulin response, their body will efficiently produce an appropriate amount of insulin to usher the sugar into cells for energy, returning their blood sugar to a normal range relatively quickly.
      * - **Insulin Level**: Insulin levels will increase temporarily as a response to the sugar intake, but since Person A's body utilizes insulin efficiently, these levels will decrease back to a baseline once the sugar is processed.
    * **Person B: Normal Insulin Production but High Insulin Resistance**
      * - **Blood Sugar Level**: When Person B eats the candy, their blood sugar will also rise. But due to the insulin resistance developed from habitual high sugar consumption, their body's cells won't respond to insulin as readily. This can result in prolonged elevated blood sugar levels because the sugar isn't being used or stored as efficiently.
      * - **Insulin Level**: In response to the sugar intake, Person B's body will produce a surge of insulin. However, due to insulin resistance, more insulin than usual might be needed to process the same amount of sugar. Over time, this chronic high production can strain the pancreas and further worsen insulin sensitivity.
    * **Person C: Type 1 Diabetes**
      * - **Blood Sugar Level**: After eating candy, Person C's blood sugar will spike. Due to their body's inability to produce adequate insulin, the sugar from the candy won't be effectively moved into cells, leading to high blood sugar levels for an extended period unless they administer exogenous insulin.
      * - **Insulin Level**: Person C's pancreas won't produce a sufficient amount of insulin in response to the candy. This is the crux of Type 1 Diabetes. To manage their blood sugar levels, they would need to inject the required amount of insulin or use an insulin pump.
