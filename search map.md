  * TODO: this is work in progress
  * what is it?
    * me: i think it is just a place to tag RELATED objects to help with search - can be under any node, not just pages. Also, not all tags need to be here, can also put them outside search maps if makes more sense
    * a structure used that helps me search my mind map as quick as possible
    * unique structure for each node, but also it can be generalized in some ways (generalizations not always accurate tho)
      * top level is usually most abstract or high-level
  * questions
    * how does it work?
      * tag this node to indicate to me what it is and beside it place the top-most node (could be multiple)
      * then, nest lower-level more concrete nodes underneath it - they are all mostly for search/filter/tag reasons - but maybe leave some comments to help me understand if needed? (but getting me to understand and recall is mostly job of [[recall map]])
