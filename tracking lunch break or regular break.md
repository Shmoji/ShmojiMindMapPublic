      * most videos and articles i wanted to check out today, i couldnt during lunch bc too exhausted. But then i also wanted to watch reviews on meta smartglasses - and i could do that - which informed me on if i wanted to buy or not
      * i hope to find more aligned breaktime activities like this bc it hard and typically i just chill - which is often needed tbh
