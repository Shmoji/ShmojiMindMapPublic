  * key points
    * memories are modified by recall
  * questions
    * where are memories stored in any biological system (not just human brain)
      * Michael Levin: in the relationship between the system and the observer
    * why is it pretty easy to understand (even if not perfectly) the content of your *own* mind and the engrams of memories you formed?
      * Michael Levin: It’s precisely because the relationship with your own mind *is* constant functional intervention. Via active inference and other strategies, you (the emergent virtual governor) are constantly intervening in your own cognitive medium (which is harder for others to do from the outside). The internal perspective is privileged for this reason – because it’s an active, functional one (not a pure observational system of read-decode).
      * me: bc it's not purely observational system of read-decode like with other person. You are emergent virtual governor of this particular body. Your intervening with system creates relationship between observer and system...this relationship is where memory is stored
