  * what is it?
    * Safe{Core} Protocol is an open, modular framework to make smart accounts secure, portable, and composable
  * different parts of it
    * Auth Kit
      * my issue: seems to rely on Web3Auth which is vendor-locked
      * what it do?
        * my understanding is it may allow you to have app that is totally web2 login. On web2 login -> a wallet is generated -> then you can generate DID from wallet (for Ceramic data storage using DID:PKH)
