slow down and reconnect with what is alive for you

This event is just a prompt. Slow down and take some time to connect with what is alive for you. For the Vibecamp event or just in life.

This event is more like coworking or parallel play, no leader needed. No socializing required...unless that's alive for you =)

im shmoji, ill be there doing my own thing and im happy to provide an ear if needed and always happy to connect! (can spot me bc im the ginger)
