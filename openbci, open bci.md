      * THE COMPLETE ULTRACORTEX is apparently the most used open-source EEG headset - just saw that on openBCI email
  * their tech
    * og Galea headset
      * the facepad (xr headset)
        * [[EOG, electrooculogram, electrical eye tracking]]
          * separate horizontal and vertical EOG networks
        * [[EEG, electroencephalogram]]
          * 2 EEG electrodes - fp1 and fp2
          * brain sensing electrodes
        * [[PPG, photoplethysmography]]
          * measures heart rate and [[heart rate variability HRV]]
        * [[GSR, electrodermal activity network, galvanic skin response]]
        * [[EMG, electromyography]]
          * 4 isolated EMG measurements
            * 2 electrodes looking at potential difference across so can see isolated or localized muscle activity in that region - have these 2 electrodes above and below each eye
      * back of headset
        * only has EEG sensors. They have custom active EEG electrodes (the things that look like brushes for cat)
          * active EEG electrodes pre-amplify the data at the recording site reducing noice compared to passive EEG electrodes
          * designed from ground up and specifically for Galea - but they prob gonna make useful for other tools too
    * Galea Unlimited
      * look like AR glasses with bci tracking and [[ear-bci|ear-wearable]] too - prob most bullish bci for me now
