  * TODO
    * [x] practice each of these places i struggled
      * [x] Practice 2nd phase of last fight with Klungo. Need to memorize to jump and attack right before last thing thrown. Need to memorize green means lava egg (which comes after ice egg)
      * [x] Practice gazebo jump
      * [x] Practice easy route at gazebo. I keep dying there
      * [x] Compare and practice Bilge Haven. Literally time self doing glitch way and then do normal way.
      * [x] Practice smoggy place in Bad Magic - Vapor Scrubs
  * Glitches / tricks
    * Gazebo Jump
      * Need to always aggro enemy you are shooting first bc sometimes eggs will not hit it otherwise
      * Banjo has 3 pixels on the mid-right side of his shadow. The launch pad has 2 pixel sections that are black and make up the border of pad, but are not at the very top. They are just before the very top on the right side. The top-most border section leading to the top has one pixel to the left that flashes. You want to get the top pixel of banjo's 3 pixel side shadow just below this flashing pixel. This is the spot. 
      * POSITIONING: You need to get into above spot while facing left. This can be hard. Moving 1 single pixel is hard. Moving 2 is much easier. Often you will move 3. 
        * Tip 1: make sure to be aiming for that flashing pixel, i kept accidentally going to the wrong one
        * Tip 2: once vertically positioned, move 2 pixels right and left over and over until in position
      * Aside from the above, speed is key. If you are in position, as long as fast enough, you will get it. You need to be instant with each button press. So, B-Crouch-Left/Down-Jump-Let go of Left/Down
        * Can think of B as triggering Crouch
        * Crouch triggering Left/Down
        * Left/Down triggering Jump
        * Jump triggering letting go of Left/Down
    * Bilge Haven Super Jump
      * Notes
        * Tips for doing it with my keyboard
          * Put middle finger on A and index finger on W. better tapping with index finger
          * For initial momentum, barely tap the key in. Just barely. This works much better than pressing it far in. Push it in as little as possible
        * Start with holding left and tapping UP as many times as possible as quick as possible (important to be FAST)...UNTIL you can feel you have initial momentum
        * Don't switch to Up-left until you know you have initial momentum built. If that initial momentum dies off, then start from beginning
        * Once you have initial momentum, start doing up-left up-left up-left (don't hold left anymore).
        * Once you have FULL momentum, jump and you'll go high
        * Prepare to do ratatat rap just in case with B
  * [[GR any%]]
    * Learning progress
      * Need to figure out where 6 extra notes are before ice eggs
    * [[GR Boss Fights]]
      * Klungo 1 and 2
        * 3, 6, 9 for items thrown. He always moves towards you after each 3. he takes damage on 3, 6, 9. Move him near portal on last wave.
      * Grunty 1
        * She moves 3 times and can take damage on 3. Then, again. Then,again, but move her to top near Kazooie. 
        * Phase near Kazooie just requires you to step under Grunty into her shadow for split second and then move back out. As usual, after 3, she can take damage.
        * She moves directly towards you until hitting something. 
      * Pirate 1
        * 3 canons shot. Right after 3, pirate appears at bottom left
        * 4 canons shot. Pirate appears middle right 
        * 4 canons shot. Pirate appears top middle

      * Grunty 2
        * Take out her hat, then her hands, then everything else.
        * Try to be accurate and use eggs sparingly. Also, try to pick eggs up everytime they spawn

        * If can't dodge her projectile, then shoot it with egg to not take damage 
        * She is always moving, so important to aim egg a lil in direction she is moving
      * Grunty 3
        * Grunty Phase 1
          * Grunty skip
            * Moves at you 3 times. Get her to move to right-bottom corner aligned with torch on 3. So, 1 stay on spawn, 2 go to left wall, and 3 bottom-right. Then, you go to top-right under torch, shoot egg at grunty right on ending of last HA audio, and instantly big jump up to mini game right after egg shot. Timing has to be perfect.
            * Seems most important thing is to jump immediately after egg is shot. Can just spam A once you are crouching.
            * Also crucial to not hold anything but crouch when you are in the backflip, otherwise you won't get enough height
          * Normal grunty phase 1: takes damage on 3rd move. On 3rd move. On 3rd move. She shoots 3, stomps, then damage. Shoots 6, stomps, then damage. Shoots 9, stomps, then damage. Rest is easy. 
        * Klungo
          * Klungo Skip: try skip right when phase starts.
          * Normal Klungo: shoots 3, takes damage. Use fire eggs to kill all ghosts. Stick to wall to kill them. Shoots 6 takes damage. Fire/ice eggs again. Shoots 9 takes damage. 
        * Grunty Phase 2
          * She moves 3, then takes damage. Packwack her ghost. Repeat. She stomps, then takes damage. Repeat. 
          * She shoots 6, stomps, then takes damage. She shoots 9, stomps, then takes damage.
          * For 2 rounds, she drops bombs on ya, pretty easy tho.
          * She shoots tracking shot and moves 3 times. Takes damage on 3. Repeat, except she moves 6 times. 
          * For ghost phase, just go stand directly below her. When you can move, just start backwacking over and over

      * I got the Roll ability and then went to Sheep Game instead of to Klungo 1
      * When jumping off hay onto music note in front of first Jinjo Statue, just do regular jump, don't roll jump. Roll jump too easy to fail and then you get big time loss

          * Make sure to jump really really damn quick before ratatat-rap to break spike before trampoline. Otherwise, you attack over spike and dont kill it.
          * Make sure to ratatat-rap between building roofs or you don't get enough distance
  * Moves/Mechanics
    * Ratatat-rap into hover

  * Notes on ROMs
    * There is PAL version and non-PAL version
      * The PAL version has 1 sec time loss on Pirate fight
      * This is what GPT said about PAL and if you read...it really seems like non-PAL has huge advantage. Will do a run and test that out.
      * Apparently if ROM has "(U)" then that means non-PAL, but idk how true that is.
      * how to tell if on PAL ROM: you are on the (E) rom if your Options menu has a Language option
  * how TOs
    * how to setup buttons on keyboard
      * thing im trying 1
        * WASD are obv
        * L = A (jump), P = B (roll)
        * L-bumper = L-shift
        * R-bumper = space
        * Start = backtick
        * Select = backspace
