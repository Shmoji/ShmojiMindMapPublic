  * what is it?
    * a measure of disorder or randomness in a system
  * key points
    * both low and high entropy are low complexity. It's in the middle where complex structure appear and thrive. 
    * for bio devices (like neurons in Cortical Labs device), low entropy is REWARD and high entropy is PUNISHMENT.
