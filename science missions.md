          * Chinese researchers have been mapping the South China Sea, searching for the perfect spot to house their new neutrino observatory. The Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT) will eventually consist of 1,211 strings of detectors attached to the sea floor, 3 km below the ocean surface. They'll enclose a 7.5 km volume of water into a giant neutrino observatory. It will be operational by 2026, and they hope it will be the most powerful in the world by 2030.
