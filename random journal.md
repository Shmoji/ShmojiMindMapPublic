	    * ready to be in Japan right this second. But cant afford that and if i did go now anyway, then i would be struggling even more financially once i do start LangSchool near end of year
	    * Around $1600 per month to cover errthing. About $17000 for one year. And those numbers come from pretty dang cheap rent and mostly Matsuya
	    * i coulddddd take job in Durham or NY rn....and work a while and then to LangSchool in April....but im soooo ready to just be in Japan. If i was rational and not thinking about if i randomly croak scenario, I'd probably just get a job.
