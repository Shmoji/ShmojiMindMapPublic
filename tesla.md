  * my tesla predictions
    * My prediction is that teslas are going to be running a decentralized network soon for many different functionality - one being handling inference of Grok. 18 billion transistors in a Tesla that basically just arent being used while car isnt being used. Incentive program will be setup that pays the vehicle owner for the usage. Although, this will be a part of Tesla bots too - not just the vehicles
  * what is it?

  * interesting points
    * Robert Scoble: 18 billion transistors in a Tesla (apparently in glove compartment??). This basically means a lot of compute could be happening here. Could be decentralized network for compute, for ai, for ai inference, etc
