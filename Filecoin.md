  * what is it?
    * me: another type of storage
    * me: i thought it was IPFS pinning service...but apparently not i think
    * their site: Filecoin is built on top of the same software powering [IPFS protocol](https://docs.ipfs.tech/), which is a peer-to-peer distributed storage network that leverages [content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/) to allow permanent references to the data, and avoids relying on specific devices or cloud servers for addressing the content. Filecoin is different from IPFS because it has an incentive layer on top to incentivize contents to be reliably stored and accessed.
    * web3.storage: The Filecoin network is a great building block for any decentralized storage system. Independent storage providers periodically must cryptographically prove that they are physically storing your specific data for a specific duration of time. When they submit these proofs to the network, other nodes verify these proofs, and this is what ends up on the Filecoin blockchain. So, anyone at any given moment can trustlessly verify that specific content is persisted, the number of copies on the network, and with who they are stored with.

    * Now due to FVM, Filecoin is the L1 poised to power the open data economy.

  * questions
    * can data stored on filecoin get deleted?
      * Yes. Very similar to IPFS. IPFS is basically, if your node stops running or you stop paying for service, your data gone. Filecoin is basically same.
