    * went super smooth. It hurt a little. Felt a 4/10 pinch and kept feeling pinch for 1-2 minutes. Felt self tense up. But that was it.
    * Was reading Baghavad Gita which talks about focusing inward and letting go of all sensations. So i tried this during pinching feelings and did indeed feel body relax. I also had to let go of (the desire to let go and get outcomes of relaxation).
