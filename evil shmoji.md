      * i really like this idea bc it allows me to think outside the box. Many of my limitations are self imposed and using this persona allows me to break out of my limits. Evil Shmoji is free

      * seems like i post here whenever the content i want to post feels like it would somehow conflict with my main audience. I feel internally conflicted about posting that content on my main account bc i feel it will either not add value or it will subtract value to my main audience. Hmmm but i wonder if that's the wrong way to do it. Maybe everything really should be on my main account. Maybe i dont need to curate for some audience. Like why am i curating for them? I think bc i want to add as much benefit to others as possible AND at same time stay my authentic self. Bc i want to do both - this causes conflicts and i guess EvilShmoji is way to resolve those conflicts bc here i will just post whatever the fuck i want without regards to others.
      * So does this thought process assume that being completely authentic does not always benefit others? Yea i suppose so. Makes sense bc i know the general things my main audience likes and gets value from and i know what they generally dont like. It's basically the same thing as not wanting your family to see your OnlyFans account
      * I suppose new tech will eventually fix this so you can keep everything on one account and the tech will help everyone only get the content they want to get - but that's probably kinda far away
