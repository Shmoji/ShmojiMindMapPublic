  * tracking taste based on type of Coffee
    * Dark Coffee
      * from Japan famima
        * [[2025-04-08]] tastes maximal bitter. tbh not much taste aside from straight bitter burnt dirt taste. Not much of a aftertaste
    * Blend Coffee
      * from Doutor
        * [[2025-04-11]] has a light/open taste. Not really bitter, but maybe a lil bitter in there. It's like if water was coffee, but still tasted good - not just like a watery drink. Aftertaste is also very very light, but nice coffee flavor.
