    * chapter 4 - Temple of Light
      * questions
        * [[2024-03-23]]
          * what did Horza see in inner part of temple that was so bad? Was it just the lasers bouncing back and forth killing people?
          * at the end it almost seemed worded like Yalson and Horza were somehow similar species - or maybe he was just saying all creatures know what sex is
    * chapter 5 - Megaship
      * tracking thoughts
        * [[2024-03-28]]
          * i dont get why Horza killed other Changers that wanted to send their home asteroid of Heibohre away from war into neutral space. The ruling class of Changers wanted to because Changers were now in big demand to fight for the Idirans who have control over that space now (money i guess?) - but why did Horza care?
        * [[2024-04-26]]
          * Lenipobra didnt know gravity on Olmedreca is 20x stronger than theyre used to and didnt know AG didnt work - he jumped over edge to land below on platform and splattered to death
          * Mipp had to leave everyone behind because the iceberg was demolishing the Olmedreca as it attacked from the mist. Horza luckily made it back to the CAT. No one else did and is most likely dead.
          * Lamm shot holes in CAT and hit Mipp good as they ditched Lamm and others. Then, Lamm detonated nuke he had on him.
          * Mipp and Horza fly over tiny island with one mountain. There is a shuttle a bit bigger than CAT there. Mipp saw person with gun and decided to fly away from island - despite Horza disagreeing because they cant make it to safety in time before Culture blows Vavatch up - so he prob thinks shuttle on island is only option. Chapter ends and sounds he may try to steal ship from Mipp
    * chapter 6 - the Eaters
      * tracking thoughts

    * chapter 7 - A Game of Damage
      * tracking thoughts
        * [[2024-05-10]]
          * the concept of Damage is so cool, especially the emotion beaming tech
          * the scale of all these environments is so epic
          * Kraiklyn RIP
          * Horza finds CAT inside GSV with some of crew still alive including Yalson. And Kraiklyn's newly picked up apprentice which is somehow Balveda from beginning of story
    * chapter 8 - end
      * [[2024-07-08]]
        * well finished main story today
        * Horza and CAT barely escapes the Ends of Invention ship and the ring world
        * They all head to Schar's world where they search for the Mind everyone is looking for
        * Idirans had already made it to the Command System inside Schar's World first. They killed all the Changers there including Horza's ex loved one
        * many battles between Idirans and Medjel slaves and the CAT squad
        * in end, every person dies except Balveda, the Mind, and the Drone - damnnit i hate that
  * characters
    * the Mind from beginning of book
      * [[2024-02-23]]
        * it escaped Idiran ships by using hyperspace - which is intelligence that Idirans apparently dont even know how to do yet
        * rumored that the Mind is from new class of General Systems Vehicles the Culture is developing
      * [[2024-07-09]]

        * [[2024-02-24]]
          * according to Horza they have absolutes around life is good, death is bad, pain is bad, pleasure is good. Apparently day-to-day they dont embody these and they use Special Circumstances as way to cover up necessary evils they do in war

        * [[2024-05-13]]
          * again Horza's dialogue - apparently the Culture had the goal to take the unfairness out of existence. I wonder if that means they are trying to make life non-merit based
    * the Contact section
      * apparently military of the Culture?
    * The Idirans
      * [[2024-02-23]]

      * questions
        * what do they stand for?
          * tracking thoughts

    * The Ends of Invention
      * old demilitarized GSV culture ship
      * where CAT is stored after Game of Damage
  * questions
    * what is meaning of weird quote that appears in Horza's mind multiple times throughout book?
      * it is revealed at end to be a quote from fictional book that Keirachell had
    * why were the Culture and the Idirans fighting?
      * they're both basically religions not willing to back down
      * the Culture feels urge to not be useless and basically expands and invades due to this. But also want peace. Book said Idirans threatened their purpose some reason and that's why war needed
      * the Idirans just only care about their race and also conquest.
