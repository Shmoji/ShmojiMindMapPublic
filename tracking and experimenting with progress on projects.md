  * tracking HOW TO make progress on multiple LARGE projects and pondering on specifics
    * [[2023-12-26]]
      * just realized this is what college was. Each class was big black hole. Yet you could consistently make progress on everything. But typically the juicy progress was not made in the required hour class period every other day. 
      * So my classes are 1) emote project 2) interactive discord, X streaming, emote collab experience (magick) 3) ai agents (olas, predictoor), 4) anon adventure 5) selenium order food (maybe shorter class)
      * it seems the key might be to actually get bite-sized tasks written out for all of these. Like a teacher creating their syllabus and actual work for students. I need to do that planning process and the actual work itself.
      * if you just stare at huge ass tasks, higher chance you wont do anything. But if you get those bite-sized tasks, you're gonna do gud
      * i think the main thing im trying to do here is prevent stagnation that i always get. I get stuck bc dont know which big project should i be working on. Do i just choose 1 big project? i dont think so - i wanna do all.
      * so should i schedule this out like classes? maybe everything can be like classes and then one gets priority for homework or extra time like back in the day. i remember at one point my unity games were the extra one thing. Then question wiki was extra one thing. Then share anything was. Then other times it was some class itself. i remember studying extra on astronomy and physics bc of my passion for it.
      * i could just let the extra thing be whatever works best with my mood in the moment - i think that's maybe what i already do. If mood is none of them, then dont do it or force self to do it idk
