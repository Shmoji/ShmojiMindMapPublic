  * questions
    * cant SOMETHING get diagnosed if mycotoxins are very high? Because healthy people may have some mycotoxins from regular day, but would be tangibly lower than someone with CIRS
      * Seems answer is this should be the case. Here is research paper showing why:
      * study that found that 93% of people with chronic fatigue syndrome had mycotoxins in their urine. Mainly orchatoxin. The healthy controls had barely any mycotoxins in their urine. Atleast according to this study mold sick people have significantly more mycotoxins in their urine and healthy people barely have any. It also suggest that mold likely plays a role in chronic fatigue syndrome. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705282/
