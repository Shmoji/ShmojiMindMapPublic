  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Got Blue Cross letter about "treatment" from Sarah Garwood on 9/2/2022. I received it because BC paid medical benefits for me and they need to find out if another party is responsible for payment. They asked the Rawlings Company to help determine if other party is responsible. 
    * Last night was one of most painful nights ever with the jaw/throat pain. Felt like today was leading that direction too, but i think after going on run, the pain subsided due to the run...interesting
  * [[TODO soon]]

    * [x] Fit dentek (IMPORTANT)
