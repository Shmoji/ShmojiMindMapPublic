    * Yesterday was indeed stone getting to bladder. Now im trying to figure out how to tell how far through urethra it is. Hard to tell. Thought i could blast it out with one large pee and didnt work.
    * Usually pain is felt at very end of pee stream. Also feel pain in balls right now. Kinda feel near intersection of bladder and urethra. Maybe that means it is stuck there.
    * Took 2 oxy for blasting this boi out in one swoop. It made me sick to stomach and i puked yay.
