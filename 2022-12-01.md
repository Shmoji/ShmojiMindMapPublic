    * Saw Dr Taylor of Triangle ENT. He said it looks like either mold toxicity or yeast infection. Maybe both. He scraped nail on skin and because it left strong line, i have mass cell activation. Not worst he has seen tho. Grimhood said can also be sign of edema and insulin resistance. He took my blood to look at in-depth thyroid and maybe something else. He wants me to do in-depth VCS mold test. Either on Dr Ritchie Shoemakers's website survivingmold.com or vctest.com. Also wants me to take Quercetin 500mg 2x/day. It is antihistamine-like drug i guess, i need to do more research on it. I think it is OTC. He recommended Dr Afrin for MCAS. After looking at my pee test, he said it slightly looks like yeast, but oxalic acid was not issue, which usually is issue with yeast
    * Dr Taylor recommended religious health help and nurse said MediShare is one of them. Turns out MediShare is good for new conditions like breaking leg or car accident. So it would not help me. Talked with guy that works there. He said i can maybe look into NeedyMeds
    * I took the VCS test on vcstest.com - can see my results there. They were positive, which means possible toxins, mold, or nutrient deficiencies present.
