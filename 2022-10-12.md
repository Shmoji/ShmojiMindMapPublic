      * Mobile, Alabama

        * Extremely ghetto part of Mobile
        * On way here we passed through Atlanta Georgia as sun just set. Some reason i started feeling physical fear. Almost felt connected to the darkness of night and my physical pain
        * Pronounced Mobeel

        * Awesome Marriott hotel. Frigid inside. Awesome outside area, but wasps got crazy. 14th floor, could see gulf and downtown. 

        * Extremely awesome healthy food restaurant. Ate Curry Stir Fry and raspberry tea that actually didn't have added sugar. Little corner restaurant in a health food store. 
        * Juicy Crab. Food in bags. Paper on table. Gloves. Bibs. Shrimp not deskinned. Thought sausage was undercooked. Potatoes connected and looked like ballsack. 

        * Went on walk to use daily incense for chance at catching xxx. At one point i realized i was feeling something somewhat intense, but not sure what. Not fear. Maybe happiness and excitement to be adventuring with my uncle. but not totally sure
      * Pensacola, Florida
        * Fort Pickin-s your nose

        * Downtown Pensacola. Multiple raids. Shiny Xernias with jazz band playing at median between roads. Gluten free pizza

      * Trip ending

        * Noticed times when pain was present, but due to being active, it didn't bother me as much and I didn't even need to force myself past it. 
        * Experimenting with consistent antihistamine

        * Experimenting with no CBD maybe leads to no burning skin
  * [[Log of health notes]]
