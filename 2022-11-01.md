    * Saw Dr Creed today of Neurology. He was awesome and did everything possible to help. 
    * Dr Creed said hormone issues and thyroid issues cause hair loss. He said my thyroid looked good, i guess that was based on thyroid blood tests? I'll be getting thyroid ultrasound tomorrow
    * Apparently burning sensations or pins and needles is often caused by small nerve fiber damage. If symptoms get worse, he said i can call anytime to try nerve pain meds like gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine. Also recommended i get back in touch with ENT to at least say nothing found at Neurology 
    * Lymph node on left side near thyroid is smaller today. Wonder if due to Bs weed?
    * Started day with only slight skin burning. By end of day, burning bad and sinus pressure and pain bad. 
    * I removed air thing from car after vid talking about how can mess with sinuses
    * Noticed my sore muscles that had recovered some, actually got more sore again 
    * Gonna sound weird, but had slight relief of sinus pressure after one of these events that happened at about same time: 1) removed large boogie in right nostril 2) put blue light glasses on
  * [[Shmoji Journal]]
    * Sometimes i catch myself punishing myself for emotions i dont enjoy. For example, during first GR any% speedrun, I felt a good bit of anxiety and made myself feel bad for feeling that. I didn't let it process and instead skipped right to trying to feel better feelings.
    * I realized this morning i have a drawing to helping people emotionally and with life issues. I'm about to start the job search. I'm going to search for management of coder jobs, jobs related to emotions, and dev jobs if needed.
