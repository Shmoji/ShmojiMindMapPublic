  * 県 -> 市 -> 区 -> 町 (2 diff suffix versions) -> 丁目 -> 通り #[[learning japanese journal]] #japmemo ^H7NeKNxV6
    * **-shi** is a self-contained city with its own mayor and government, while **-ku** is a subdivision that doesn’t have full autonomy—it’s managed by the larger city or metropolis.
    * A -shi might contain many -ku (if it’s big enough), or it might just have neighborhoods and -chōme directly.
    * prefecture: 県 for 43. All four (-ken 県, -to 都, -fu 府, -dō 道) are prefectures—top-level administrative divisions under the national government, each with a governor and assembly. The different suffixes are more about tradition than any real difference in governance now. Japan has:
      * 43 -ken (e.g., Kanagawa-ken, Chiba-ken)
      * 1 -to (東京都). 都 = metropolis or capital
      * 2 -fu (Osaka-fu, Kyoto-fu). 府 = urban prefecture...really just same as prefecture, but signaling historical key city
      * 1 -dō (Hokkaidō). 道 = road/circuit; really just same as prefecture, but signaling historical key region
    * 通り = とおり alone and どおり when compounded like in street name like 竹下通り (Takeshita Street)
    * 番地 (banchi), 号 (gō) - literally means number. order in 住所: 丁目 > 番地 > 号
