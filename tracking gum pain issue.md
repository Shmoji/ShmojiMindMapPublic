      * it appeared for first time in a while few days ago. My only ideas: 1) ate sotanghon two days in a row and it had lil fried pieces of garlic (also has chicken broth in it) 2) been eating a lot of pretzel sticks lol
      * my stomach got all messed up around same time this appeared. Kind of tummy pain that is hard to differentiate between upset tummy or back/kidney pain
