  * what it allows, tech, features
    * HEADSET: Brain Sensei
      * HUGE bci headset with no facepad BUT has spot to connect XR headset/facepad
    * auto donning - automates the process by calibrating the sensors to each user's heads without needing assistance from a technician.
    * Brain GPS (maps the brain and precisely correlates the sensors with the correct functional areas)
      * this basically solves 2 big issues 1) our heads are different shapes and sizes yo 2) operator error - placement of brain tracking devices often not precise. Fixing these errors allows for precise standardization of brain data
    * Brain Cloud (Brain Data is denoised, standardized and automatically tagged ready for ai models)
      * This seems like some sort of centralized storage method specifically of brain data. Not sure how i feel about that. Users dont own their data basically.
    * Brain insight (data-based indicators of human behavior)
      * allows devs to hyper-personalize products and services based on the user's mental state
  * noteworthy stuff
    * In 2022, brain.space conducted brain activity experiment on ISS using their headset operated by astronauts of Axiom-1. Wanted to determine whether brain activity recorded at microgravity different from Earth gravity.
