            * Annihilation
	            * old notes from Evernote
				    * Natalie Portman as Lena
				    * Meteorite hits and creates barrier around lighthouse that keeps growing. Inside is called the shimmer
				    * Lena's husband Kane went into the shimmer and was the first to come out, but he was all weird
				    * So, Lena goes into the shimmer with a team.
				    * Inside, all DNA flows like light and everything is mutating
				    * Prob the hardest part to watch: they find film of Kane cutting open friends stomach and you see giant shit moving around in his stomach
				    * Huge bear/possum gets Cass Shepherd. The part of her afraid and dying mutated with the bear. You see it later and the bear's voice is Shepherd's screaming help me.
				    * Josie Radek turns into flower basically, she accepts it.
				    * In lighthouse, thing goes inside Dr Ventress, then she turns into light bubbles basically. Those form into something that Lena looks into with wonder. Then, it turns human shaped and metal-looking. She runs and bumps into another that mimics everything she does. It turns into her as she hands it grenade. Blows up and kills everything with fire.
				    * Think it was legit just alien life mutating shit in a realistic way. It had no intentions, it was just a form of life.
