  * list of opportunities
    * CATEGORY: im maybe interested and qualify
      * vitalia city
      * potential grad school/research opportunities 4 me - some very Emote related
        * Canada - Simon Fraser Uni (resonates the most so far with what they focus on and vibe)
          * there is professor/researcher **Carman Neustaedter** there doing stuff with HCI and connecting people over distance like me - it resonates
          * it's cold there but doesnt seem toooo bad - like Boone i think
          * SFU has multiple campuses with the main one situated on Burnaby Mountain. Additionally, it has campuses in Vancouver and Surrey.
          * safe place
        * New Zealand: The University of Auckland may be good uni there
          * my reasons: idk New Zealand seems cool. Also their app description seems very researcher oriented which is dope
          * apparently one of best places on earth to be for nuclear winter lol
          * emote resonates with Uni of Auckland's HCI Lab and Empathic Computing Laboratory - but it seems a lil dead compared to Carman's lab
        * Canada - Uni of Waterloo for their HCI lab
          * http://hci.cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/
        * Canada - Uni of Toronto for their DGP
          * https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/join
        * not for Fulbright, but still grad/research: Stanford:
          * how my emotes resonates with Stanford: **Stanford University** has been highlighted through the work of Jeff Hancock, PhD, who directs the Social Media Lab. His research delves into how technology affects human communication, including the psychological and social impacts of mediated communication, which is directly relevant to connecting people across distances.
          * possible things to help here:

          * Switzerland - **University of Zurich**
            * Minh Hao Nguyen, has research focusing on how new media technologies are used for communication over distance, particularly in the context of health and social connection. It seems basically related to emote. But it looks like more publication and less doing actual stuff compared to Carman
            * seems like safe place with Boone-like temps
            * kinda close to Ukraine

            * not a cost thing, i just missed 2024 apps...but got on mailing list yay lol
        * what is it?
          * Polaris is a 9 month programme running from January 2024 to September 2024, you will join a cohort of 24 smart, earnest, and high-expectation individuals.
          * The first 3 months are lightly structured, with weekly meetings to get to know your peers, and explore and discuss the curriculum (detailed below).
          * Thereafter, you will have free rein to work on whatever you deem to be a good use of your programme time and resources. There will be standing get-togethers and dinners, and you can expect your peers to be a source of accountability, but your time and your priorities are your own.
          * The fellowship is divided into two phases. During the first phase (3 months), you will be expected to dedicate one evening a week to meeting with the fellows, and there will be readings which take approximately 1 or 2 hours a day to complete. The second phase of the programme is your opportunity to pursue ambitious work. Apart from a fortnightly meeting, the time is yours to spend wisely.
          * curriculum
            * The Polaris curriculum is a deep dive into the very early days of some of the groups and movements which have come to define our present.
            * From our privileged position, their visions for the future seem obvious; we regularly fail to remember that the edifices they built over decades or millennia started as messy projects pursued by marginal people, seen by their contemporaries as unserious, cringe-worthy, radical, and dangerous.
            * Over the first 11 weeks of the fellowship, we will be meeting as a group to discuss the ways our distance from the past might mislead us about our ability to impact the future. Our exploration of the early days of the Enlightenment, the arrival of the Counterculture, and the emergence of Cyberculture will give us stories, anecdotes, and frames with which to interpret the present, and give you more context and better judgement with which to think about your future.
        * where at?
          * Polaris is running in Oxford, Cambridge and London. It is not limited to students studying at universities in these places, however participants must be able to attend weekly cohort meetings in-person.
          * Am I eligible for Polaris if I am not in the UK?
            * We do not support people to relocate for the fellowship. (but maybe if fren lemme couchsurf, then it's fine?)
      * Topos House
        * questions
          * why dont circumstances allow?

            * $1600/month
          * [ ] are there any other topos things i could participate in?
          * [ ] any obligations? any set course program like a school or what?
        * they house 6-12 residents that are scientists at a time with a focus on interdisciplinary collaboration.
        * first thing on their site resonates alot with me: A community of scientists dedicated to life-long learning.
        * physical building
          * Our SF house is 4000 sq ft with 5 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. The middle floor is dedicated to collaborative learning while the top floor is a quiet library for common study. Most bedrooms have private en-suite bathrooms and views of the Bay or the Ocean.
      * Emergent Ventures

            * i got rejected lol
      * MEXT Scholarship
        * missed deadline
      * Fulbright Programs
        * tracking learnings
          * [[2024-09-20]]
            * fulbright scholarships or programs i seem to qualify for that is still open
              * from Japan Fulbright website -> scholarships for americans: Graduate Research Student Program - https://us.fulbrightonline.org/countries/east-asia-pacific/japan/1582
                * RIP: requires 2 years of prior Japanese learning at a uni AND affiliate letter from host uni
              * looks like i would have fit for the Research Fellow Program, but i just missed deadline i think: https://fulbrightscholars.org/award/all-disciplines-research-33
                * i think this is one that requires affiliate sponsor by professor at uni in host country
              * useful nuggets about me (for telling people)
                * id love to do research (emerging tech, social tech, sciences), learn Japanese, creative writing (not qualified), go to graduate school
                * mainly focused on Japan rn, but open to other countries potentially
              * key notes i discovered
                * WHAT AWARDS I CAN GET: in terms of App Components or awards, i think i only fit into the Study/Research category i see on the fulbrightonline website - none of the other categories. Specifically the Academic portion of the Study/research category - there's another one for creative and performing arts and id love to do creative writing, but dont think id qualify based on my past
                * HOW TO APPLY: in AppComponents sections of fulbrightonline site at bottom is really good video explaining how to apply
                * AFFILIATES: seems most programs require you to somehow find "affiliate" in host country and get in contact with them and use them for something im not sure of. Maybe only for research programs? and is it all research programs or just some?
              * brainstorming
                * im maybe interested in these countries too
                  * Canada where not deathly cold
                  * United Kingdom - Glascow is where Lee Cronin is
            * good places to find programs actually being offered for fulbright

            * notes from meeting today with **Dara Carney-Nedelman** about Fulbright Programs
              * programs she recommended:
                * https://www.princetoninasia.org/fellowships
                  * kinda like internship
                * FOREIGN AFFAIRS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FELLOWSHIP
                * QUAD fellowship
                * NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION. **GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM**
              * Q: if i had research idea, could i apply to fulbright with that?
                * dont have to tie my project to host country, but have to find an affiliate to sponsor research project AT UNI in other country - which is tight timeline with regard to Fulbright deadline being in a week lol
                * she gave example of someone learning things in host country and documenting it so people could see the experience in VR somehow. She said these people propose research ideas and then Fulbright finds them funding
                * sadly seems the Japan research program requires 2 uni years of Japanese language study
              * the NCS office at AppState can support me (alumni) for any programs consistently, but just not fulbright since it just about to end
                * they can help me with writing apps
              * it seems i can still apply to fulbright tho. But maybe research always requires affiliate so i cant do research program, but can do graduate program? EDIT: yea on fulbrightonline site for academic research AppComponent you have to have affiliate sponsor you
            * so seems im out of luck for Fulbright bc i dont have affiliate sponsoring me and deadline soon
            * altho just learned some programs are more lenient, so maybe ill still apply
          * [[2024-09-26]]
            * what is hard about research/study program i was trying for:
              * requires 3 different people from accredited PLACE (seems unis are best) to write entire letter recommending you omg
              * you need affiliate from host country to sponsor you (most likely from university)
