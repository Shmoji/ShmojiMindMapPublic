      * [[2024-08-21]] grapes from dad's garden #memo
        * dad grew grapes this year. Told me they were native to NC and often used for wine. they're BIG and round. Called muscadines. often these are a dark or black color, but we specifically grew scuppernong muscadines which are a green or bronze color
        * Scuppernong' is the oldest muscadine cultivar. It was selected from the wild along the Scuppernong River in North Carolina.
        * cultivar means humans selected desired traits over years to get this type of grape. variety means more natural, but it seems these are both tbh
        * The scuppernong is the state fruit of North Carolina
