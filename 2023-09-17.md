    * sometimes i get this extremely vivid rush of presence. Often everything in vision becomes more shiny and life is euphoric in general. i wonder if this is a signal that this current moment is an important moment for the future...or if it's just some chemical body thing.
    * I can actually look at this extremely vivid part of self internally when it's happening.
    * When it happens and i notice for first time, i observe it and then everything becomes even more vivid. It seems like i forget the past in some specific way and the present moment is just all up in my focus.
