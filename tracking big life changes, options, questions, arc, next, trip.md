  * tracking general
    * [[big life change, options, questions from 2023]]
    * [[2024-08-18]]
      * well im running out of money in savings and i got a very rough MVP for whyspia - so i think i gotta figure out what next
      * 2 options came up today: somewhere campus and Emergent Ventures Grant/Fellowship - ill prob apply and hope for best
    * [[2024-09-04]]
      * denied from Emergent Ventures
      * i finished somewhere campus app, but no response. i think they may be ded now tbh - no online presence
      * emailed Gradient Retreat...but i think theyre closed now
      * before this break i still wanna do these at minimum: ^GdYV9u6zm
        * [x] new whyspia account system that works for mom, dad, and still makes me happy in terms of security
        * [ ] new whyspia notif system using push notifs on mobile, email notifs, and phone number notifs
        * [ ] actively using whyspia with fam/frens once i do the above
        * MAYBE: new data storage method for whyspia that aligns with my principles (maybe ASI makes this pointless??)
        * [x] finish story i started
        * [ ] learn the fundamental stuff ive noted down while i have the time
        * [ ] do one cool thing with my BCI
      * im now looking into graduate programs. there's several. god these app processes are confusing and suck tho. maybe ai can help but idk
    * [[2024-09-05]]
      * for many of these full ride scholarships, you first have to be accepted to the university first before even applying to scholarship...and applying to the university is a LONGGGGG and shitty process
      * universities im thinking of applying to grad school at:
        * uni of tokyo
        * ritsumeikan uni
        * appstate
        * stanford
        * mit
      * but im really only interested if i get a full-ride...so if unis accept me but no fullride guaranteed...then guess i just have to decline
    * [[2024-09-10]]
      * applied to recurse center
      * looked into Topos House. Sounds amazing and room is open, but rent is $1600/month...and im done with the 9-5...and idk how i feel about moving to Cali tbh not too hype about that
      * Applications for the Polaris Fellowship in 2024 have closed, but i got on email list...yay. Same for Arc Institute Core Investigators
    * [[2024-09-19]]
      * denied from Recurse Center. Cooldown is 3 months lol
      * seems i am too late for Fulbright program. App closes in 2 weeks and you need person from host uni to sponsor you for research. Although i may still apply just in case. it seems some programs are more lenient when it comes to sponsor
    * [[2024-09-23]]
      * did bunch of research on unis for grad school - especially those that would work with Fulbright and that have programs/people that are researching Emote related things
    * [[2024-10-07]]
      * just realized im mixing up this and [[tracking what im doing]]
      * i learned that almost all independent study requires you to have PHD and multiple years research experience after that...sheeeesh
    * [[2024-10-14]]
      * okay, [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking what im doing#^TQPZ2UKoW|well i submitted my Fulbright Grant application...but wont know if im semifinalist until Jan 25 and wont know if finalist until many months after that (as early as late February to as late as June) and program starts in September 2025. So i cant really count on that for what im doing and should do. I could wait all that time and just get rejected]]
      * i just sent email to Carman of SFU cLab - which is basically an application to that specific grad program. According to site, if im accepted, the start is September 2025
    * [[2024-10-16]]
      * have call with Carman in about 2 weeks yay
      * submitted interest in FractalNYC coliving for 2 months from Dec 1 to Feb 1 - no idea if ill get response back
    * [[2024-11-01]]
      * call with Carman went fantastic
      * notes from Carman meeting
        * application due January - for September start - need reference letters
        * i should apply, put his name as supervisor. He will email link to apply
        * thesis based vs course-based grad degrees. He and me recommend thesis-based. You work on project for 1 year.
        * he has to see if he can get funding for my research. Even once school ends, i guess they still fund you through those break - which i guess means you still work on your project
    * [[2024-11-23]]
      * okay, now that grad school is figured out i gotta think about what to do with life arc before it starts (about 7-9 months)
      * money brainstorming
        * if i sell car i can get about: 10kUSD
        * OCEAN tokens will unlock July 15th - no idea how much but iz pretty significant i think
        * if markets keep going like rn, maybe can just take some of that out already
      * places to go brainstorming ^yRlKxfZSj
        * obv Japan
        * need to budget it with money i have, but maybe The Embassy that gptbrook recommends in SF (my guess is cost of expensive apartment per month)
        * ask tpot frens if i can come visit
  * tracking Knight-Hennessy Scholarship to Stanford in Cali
    * tracking learnings
      * [[2024-09-04]]
        * you must submit separate but concurrent applications; one to Knight-Hennessy Scholars, and one to your Stanford graduate degree program(s)
        * guess i gotta choose the programs they offer that im interested in and qualify for and then apply
        * looks like i most likely dont qualify for the art programs bc you need good portfolio of art sadge
  * retired life stuff
    * tracking MEXT scholarship app process and info (also called Monbukagakusho scholarship)
      * tracking learnings
        * [[2024-09-04]]
          * they have 4 types of scholarships - i am only eligible for one: Research Student Scholarship
          * U.S. CITIZENS: Applications must be submitted to the MEXT Scholarship office which oversees your jurisdiction. AND you can visit office website for your jurisdiction for application requirements, forms, guidelines and for any inquiries. This is my jurisdic: https://www.atlanta.us.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_en/MEXT_E.html
          * process for applying as told in "App guidelines for research students PDF":
            * NOTE: no idea if every year follows this same schedule, but this is the one for 2024
            * April 2024: call for apps based on your jurisdiction...i think. in PDF it said "Japanese diplomatic mission"...
            * June 2024: first screening of you
            * By Aug 9th: if you pass first screening, you gotta directly contact Japanese unis that you wish to enroll to (can you do multiple? and what are the options?)
            * Mid Sep 2024: MEXT conducts second screening and uni placement (how dat work?)
            * Jan to Feb 2025: Applicants who pass the second screening and have an accepting university will be accepted as a MEXT Scholarship grantee. Results are notified to applicants via the Japanese diplomatic mission.
        * [[2024-09-05]]
          * i called my jurisdic office today:
            * on site it says applications are closed, so i was wondering if i can still prepare or apply to the next application period
            * i called and they re-open apps in 2025 late April - early May and close those apps early June 2025 - this is for 2026 that youd actually be there if accepted
            * said can look into scholarships from specific unis or from specific abroad programs - which i basically already knew that - but choosing a uni could be good idea
          * tldr: DONE with this for now, gonna leave note for myself somewhere to apply when the time comes in late April
