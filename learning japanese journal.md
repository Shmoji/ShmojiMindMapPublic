  * tracking things that in-the-moment resonated as something i should just KNOW in all moments while speaking Japanese
    * [[2025-01-10]]
      * EXPRESSING OPINIONS: using と思います。which means "i think --"
      * TODO: maybe go through all old notes and add stuff needed here to memo
    * [[2025-02-24]] learning "maybe" and errthing that goes from that #japmemo
      * かも / かもしれない
        * **meaning:** "might be," "possibly". MEME: possibly...but speculative. meme: the negative aspect of it points to speculative aspect
        * meme: かも is literally the 2 particles together. questioning and emphasizing
        * しれない is potential form - so "cannot know". Reminds me of つかえます which used to ask if can use kado at resutorans
        * seems best version of maybe since たぶん is more like probably that is less certain than おそらく
        * example:
          * 彼は来るかも
            * "he might come."
          * 雨が降るかもしれない
            * "it might rain."
      * おそらく
        * meme: troll rock was prob placed in front of door by oso (matsu)
        * **nuance:** stronger than "maybe," implying that something is quite likely but not certain.
        * **example:**
          * 彼はおそらく忙しい
            * "he's probably busy."
          * おそらく明日は晴れるでしょう
            * "it will probably be sunny tomorrow."
            * Q: what is でしょう? i thought the しょう ending was used to invite people to something or say us...but this is maybe different?
              * ちがうよ! this doesnt modify verbs like 食べましょう does
              * meme: i point out/show "probably" about thing to person like James that is too certain. 2: de show is prob good...i suppose
              * in casual speech, **だろう** is often used instead of **でしょう** (same meaning, but more direct and masculine). meme: choosing seats...probably that row...
              * exs:
                * the parent example
                * これはあなたの本でしょう？
                  * "this is your book, right?"
      * たぶん
        * **nuance:** implies a higher probability than かも but less certainty than おそらく. commonly used in everyday speech.
        * **example:**
          * たぶん彼は来る
            * "he's probably coming."
          * たぶん大丈夫だよ
            * 大丈夫 = だいじょうぶ
            * "it's probably fine."
      * けっこう
        * **meaning:** "fairly," "rather," "quite a bit", "pretty" (as in pretty good)
        * **example:**
          * この映画、けっこう面白いよ
            * meme: keiko from yuyu is pretty
            * "this movie is pretty interesting."
      * ～たり
        * **meaning:** "doing things like...". **nuance:** not directly "maybe," but used to indicate uncertainty or a non-exhaustive list of actions.
        * meme: talley this and this and this action. or dolly it
        * despite looking similar, **～たり** has nothing to do with **たる** or **たります**.
        * **example:**
          * 映画を見たり、本を読んだりした
            * "i watched movies and read books (among other things)."
            * Q: is "～たり" always just as suffix to verbs?
              * yes, **～たり** is only used with verbs, but it must be paired with another **～たり** verb or a concluding verb like **する** to form a proper sentence
              * **expressing alternating states:**
                * 天気が暑くなったり寒くなったりする
                  * 天気 = てんき. kuuki, taiki...so this makes sense. weather; not temperature
                  * 暑い = あつい
                  * meme: not NOT version of adj (that is 暑くなかった), it is actually なる. meme: to or NOT to become
                  * "the weather keeps becoming hot and cold."
            * Q: is "～たり" always only for past tense?
              * **no**, **たり** is not only for past tense, but it **requires the past tense short form of a verb** (た-form). the final verb (often **する**) determines the overall tense of the sentence.
              * **present/future tense:**
                * **映画を見たり、本を読んだりする。**
                * "i do things like watching movies and reading books." (habitual action)
              * **past tense:**
                * **映画を見たり、本を読んだりした。**
                * "i did things like watching movies and reading books." (past events)
      * 無理 = むり
        * impossible
        * meme: yuri from BE did the impossible with Satan
        * 無料 = むりょう
          * free
          * meme: yuri does things for free
        * 無量 = むりょう
          * immeasurable; infinite; inestimable
          * meme: giving is infinite
        * 無力 = むりょく
          * powerlessness; helplessness;
        * 無力感 = むりょくかん
          * sense of helplessness; feeling of powerlessness
      * 真逆 = まさか
        * **"no way,"** **"impossible,"** or **"you can't be serious."**
        * meme: i imagine gollum saying master with ka as uncertainty
        * まさかこんなところで会うとは思わなかった
          * こんな = "this kind of" - which makes sense due to donna
          * **とは** → a grammatical structure used to mark a surprising or unexpected fact
          * 思わなかった - "did not think" (negative past form of 思う) meme: dont wanna cot to sleep on - indicating negative past form. meme for 思: oh, i want more thoughts!
          * "i didn’t think (that) i would meet (you) at a place like this!"
        * まさか本気じゃないよね？
          * 本気 = ほんき = it's used when someone is truly serious about something, not joking or messing around. meme: truth and key is that im srs. ironic that honki sounds funny like honky and not srs
          * "no way, you're not serious, right?"
      * ぜったい
        * meme: definitely wearing the ZE tie bc it defs fashionable
    * [[2025-02-26]] how to get order to go, もしもし, 入れ, 店内のみ #japmemo
      * もちかえりできますか？
        * 持ち帰り = takeout; to-go
        *  持ち = to hold/carry/have
        * おもちかえりで (お typically not used unless in veryyy formal setting - GPT doesnt recommend at all really lol for this phrase at least) or もちかえりで = takeout pls
        * Q: when saying もちかえりで is it okay to add kudasai or no?
          * おねがいします is generally the better choice when making requests like this
          * おねがいします sounds more polite and fitting for requesting services/actions, while ください is better when asking for specific objects (like handing you a menu or a drink)
          * meme: oh ne guy, pls do dis action (more polite). could you slide that object here? (less polite)
        * if they ask a follow-up question, it might be:
        * 袋にお入れしますか？
          * (ふくろにおいれしますか？) – would you like a bag to put it in?
          * いれ = bag; container; inserting; putting in; (all nouns). add る for verb version
          * お入れします is just humble version of 入れる - they the same
          * meme: putting eel in bag. eeee LEt me put it in the bag?
        * 申し訳ありませんが、店内のみです
          * もうしわけありませんが、てんないのみです。) – sorry, it's for dine-in only.
          * てんないのみ = dine-in only
            * **店内 (てんない)** = inside the store/restaurant. meme: inside store is ten knives
            * **のみ** = only (a more formal version of だけ). meme: NO, only ME
          * 申し訳ありません is most formal and serious way to apologize (**business, professional, or serious** situations)
      * what is もしもし? In the various common ways it's used
        * mainly to answer phone or check if someone is still listening
        * thought to come from 申す申す (もうすもうす, mōsu mōsu), a humble way of saying "I speak, I speak.". This is humble form of 言う used when referring to yourself or your in-group in polite settings.
        * ex: 田中と申します. meme: im said to be *butler voice*
        * meme: just makes sense moshi from phone is also to say
    * [[2025-03-19]] thank yous at restaurants, being served, leaving #japmemo
      * ありがとうございます is good default polite thank you
      * どうも is also good but casual. which is fine
      * seems ill mostly blast off どうもs and ありがとうございます when really mean it. ありがとうございました at end
      * クレジットカードは使（つか）えますか？
      * 失礼します（しつれいします）- saying excuse me to leave/rei sheetz. it’s not really about expressing gratitude—explicitly saying im leaving in polite way
        * Q: does make sense when leaving restaurant or cafe?
        * AHH: this is same as おじゃまします in that can be used when leaving or entering. it's more general, where おじゃまします is focused on private/personal spaces. But when leaving 失礼します still doesnt use past tense
        * not really. **失礼します（しつれいします）** is more commonly used in formal settings, like when entering or leaving a professor's office or a workplace.
        * when leaving a restaurant or cafe, it's more natural to say:
          * **ごちそうさまでした** → to thank the staff for the meal
          * ありがとうございました → polite and general thank you
      * お邪魔しました (おじゃましました) a common phrase used when leaving someone’s home or a place where you might have been a guest. However, **お邪魔しました** is typically used in more personal or private settings where you're acknowledging that you were a guest in someone’s home or space. Not in office setting, even when casual like Sakura House office. meme: me when leaving jomama's. past tense of **おじゃまします** (お邪魔します), which is said when entering someone's space, meaning "i have bothered you" - but when said it's basically "excuse me for bothering you or intruding" but in a polite way
        * i bothered jomomma when i went to chill with you. to bother じゃま
        * ahh so one is said entering personal place and one is said leaving
      * お世話になりました (おせわになりました) - formal and polite phrase meaning "thank you for taking care of me" or "thank you for your hospitality." It’s often used when leaving a place where you’ve received help or had support, even if you weren’t directly served. 世話 = care; assistance. meme: kinda similar to heiwa of peace
      * またお越しください
        * **越す** (こす). HOW DIFF THAN IKU and KURU: **越す** is used more in the sense of crossing a boundary or moving from one place to another, often with the nuance of going over an obstacle or entering a new space. meme: takes ALOT of effort to ground wheat into ko. TO DO ko lol
        * please come/visit again
        * if they say this, dont say 失礼します after, could be rude to excuse directly after them telling you to come back lol
      * もう一杯お願いします
        * もういっぱい おねがいします
        * もう = more or already. Closer to "already" and with quantities it implies you already had one and want more
        * u know いっぱい
      * これ、必要ですか？ これ、ひつようですか？
        * he sue successfully means required/necessary and vibe indicator for that
        * 大切 = たいせつ. 太陽 = たいよう
    * [[2025-03-20]] butt warm, please exist, mase, verb + temo, diff continues #japmemo
      * お尻が暖かいのが好き
        * お尻(おしり)が暖(あたた)かいのが好(す)き
        * she really got butt
        * nomnom. warm thing
        * Japanese tends to use "states" more. i think this is more like: the warmth on my butt - i like  (笑). or butt; warmth; i like
      * いらっしゃる; いらっしゃいませ; いらっしゃい
        * to exist; to come; to be
        * to rush is opposite of this meaning lol
        * "Please come in" or "Welcome,"
        * "-ませ" (mase) ending is a polite imperative, essentially a gentle request or invitation, like saying "please do." It softens the phrase into a welcoming tone rather than a command. ma kindly say please do
      * ここで仕事を続けても大丈夫ですか？
        * at cafe after finished eating
        * Q: am i correct that つづけて is potential form and what about も?
          * (続けて) is actually the **te-form** of **続ける (つづける)**, not the potential form. Means to continue
          * **verb + てもいいですか？** is a common way to ask for permission, meaning **"is it okay if i do (verb)?"** I guess sometimes いい is dropped. them tho...is it okay? *remembers demoiidesu stuff*
        * Q: but isnt 続く "to continue", so つづけて would be potential form?
          * No, 続く (つづく) - intransitive verb and つづけて is transitive
        * if you wanted to explicitly say **"can i continue?"**, you'd use the potential form:
          * got learnt: No potential form for 続く because intransitive verbs in Japanese typically don’t have potential forms (they describe states or actions that aren’t controlled, so "ability" to do them doesn’t apply). Altho if it could have potential form, it would indeed be same as the transitive version of to continue which would be yikes
          * **続けられますか？** → "am i able to continue?"
          * **ここで仕事を続けられますか？** → "can i continue working here?"
          * but this sounds more like asking if it’s *physically* possible, not about permission. ても for permission

  * tracking thoughts on best/quickest method to learn with my current lifestyle
    * [[2024-02-25]]
      * Either ChatGPT using my prompt OR Quizlet QChat. I think QChat may be better and more interactive, but i need to try more - i just tried now but im about to pass out bc it late at night and i got no brain juice left
    * [[2024-04-01]]
      * need more time to know, but seems GPT store teacher may be best
    * [[2024-04-13]]
      * GPT store teacher was great, but im broke and now cant pay for it sadge. Also it often spoke way too fast and too complex sentences. Maybe a prompt engineering problem on my side
      * Copilot has this same issue, BUT is free.
      * i wonder if i let ai talk in english and i speak japanese - if that would be better for learning
      * myshell ai has same issues as above sadge
    * [[2024-04-20]]
      * Univerbal ended up being better than GPT store. it also costs money. going to buy 3 month sub bc it so good
    * summary of above so far: i ended up on Univerbal
  * tracking thoughts on how to learn and go about learning
    * [[2024-04-20]]
      * i realized today YOU want to interact as much as possible with meaning of symbols, not the symbols themselves. This came to me bc i was thinking of game where you just type in symbols and submit to "discover" them. And how you can do this for all symbols that youve simply encountered and that's all meaning that is there. But could also just write code to loop and autopopulate for you and then you never interacted with those yourself and no meaning at all - not even encountering the symbol.
      * point is - i think i often interact too much with the symbol itself instead of the meaning/soul behind it. I could be wrong, but almost feels like im always trying to break every symbol into parts and ask "what is it?" instead of experiencing the meaning of each symbol in a fluid emergent way and letting that emergent meaningful experience define the symbol.
      * i think both bug me lol. Breaking every symbol down and asking what is it is very time consuming and i cant learn a language bc almost no one has time to break every single little thing down for me in fastpaced convos. Also i dont even really enjoy breaking it down in the moment every time. 
      * i think experiecing the meaning in the fluid emergent way bugs me because in the moment it feels like you cant know if the meaning is going to stick or not. Breaking down the meaning at least lets you know you'll keep some meaning, but not doing that gives more opportunity for the meaning to be lost
    * [[2024-05-07]]
      * continuing with Univerbal - but i think i need to turn down to lower level bc sentences are so hard i just have a million things to learn per sentence and not even conversating - im just learning a million things that dont stick
  * tracking mistakes made
    * [[2024-05-07]]
      * i tried connecting two verbs in one sentence using と but univerbal corrected and said should use たり。。。たりする instead to list multiple actions in no particular order. Ex sentence was listing activities i use to relax before surgery.
