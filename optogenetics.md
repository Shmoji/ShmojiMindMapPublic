  * tracking thoughts on optogenetics
    * [[2024-01-21]]
      * Optogenetics is promising for mass BCI because it’s less invasive than chip implants (injection vs surgery) and maybe more bandwidth (across the whole brain, yet fine-grained).
      * However, due to genetic manipulation and coaxing our brains to fire photons, many side effects are possible. For example, what if the brain fires too much and causes a seizure? Nonetheless, given ASI risk, research needs to proceed with even more urgency than before.

  * what is it?
    * Optogenetics enables reading & writing on the brain. One gets an injection containing a “useful virus” that changes specifically targeted neurons to fire when light is shined on them
      * more precisely: *“Optogenetics is a technique to control or to monitor neural activity with light which is achieved by the genetic introduction of light-sensitive proteins. Optogenetic activators [“opsins”] are used to control neurons, whereas monitoring of neuronal activity can be performed with genetically encoded sensors for ions (e.g. calcium) or membrane voltage. The effector in this system is light that has the advantage to operate with high spatial and temporal resolution at multiple wavelengths and locations”.*
