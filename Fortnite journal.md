    * starwars guns
        * dont like
            * E11 Blaster or something
            * [[2025-05-06]] looks like itd shoot fast, but upclose it shoots slow af wtf got me killed

            * [[2025-05-07]] big damage quick, AR, not SMG quick tho or for closerange.
* Current settings im trying
    * Keybinds
        * Reload: mouse wheel in
        * Crouch: left CTRL
        * Sprint: left SHIFT
        * Building
            * Start editing: E button or one short scroll down (2 short scrolls will also reset any edits)
            * Floor - Q
            * Roof - CAPS LOCK
            * Wall - Side-mouse up button
            * Ramp - Side-mouse down button
    * Mouse
        * Mouse x/y sensitivity: about 10% for both axes
            * if you move your arm when aiming, want lower sensitivity. if you move your wrist, you want higher sensitivity.
        * Mouse targeting (aim-down-sight) sensitivity: around 45%
            * low enough to laser enemies on foot while still able to track quick moving players in air
        * Mouse scope sensitivity: around 70%
            * This gives solid control while not too slow for crosshair adjustments
        * in windows, go to mouse settings and turn off "enhance pointer precision"
        * You want arm on table, but NOT palm
        * Try using all way up to shoulder when moving mouse
        * DPI: 400 or 800
        * you want one right/left swoop of mouse to be a 360
        * i just got learnt: the only way to make all the above possible: do NOT keep PALM on table and keep arm on table as little as possible. It makes it so i can do 360 in one swoop no problem
        * Control mouse AT mouse. Dont be afraid to pick mouse up completely. Think of like youre using the mouse with a claw machine
    * Misc settings to experiment with
        * Confirm edit on release
            * this increases speed, but you can only confirm edit when on last edit block you want. Can be bad if enemy on other side of wall.
