  * what is identity?
    * who you think you are. Different from [[personality]]
  * what is a person? (maybe put these into diff note??)
    * cocreator of reality. Other creator is story - who we interact with
    * my brainstorming
      * a body
      * thoughts
      * emotions
      * all sensations
      * consciousness shard
      * entire consciousness
      * the view from outside by another person
  * ANDRES: 3 broad categories
    * closed individualism
      * start existing when born and stop when die OR reincarnation, etc
      * you are same over time
        * this feels like the case moment to moment for you and from POV of others
      * you are a segment (what dis mean?)
    * empty individualism
      * you are a point/slice (huh?)
      * you are just a moment of experience. from one moment to the next is totally different witnesser (separate entity) inhabiting brain
      * PROBLEM: apparent continuity (it feels like you are you from moment to moment)
    * open individualism
      * you are everyone
      * we are all one consciousness
      * PROBLEM: how can you exist in multiple places at once?
  * questions
    * how is identity formed
      * not based on actions. you eat a burger everyday and dont even remember it. it's the EMOTIONAL experiences that form identity. Once you stop experiencing emotions, your identity gets more locked into place

    * [[reality - what is it]]
