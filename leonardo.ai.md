  * in general/abstract terms, what it do?
    * create game assets with AI
  * in my more-precise terms, what it do? (use-cases)
    * generate 2D images just like midjourney
    * allows you to train and fine-tune your own models with your own data and generate 2D images off of that - this is probably most novel feature
    * 3D texture generation - this may be super novel
      * Not for super complex models yet. Although, one tut did an alien creature texture and i thought it was complex and pretty good tbh
      * Shows at 11 mins how good this is with choccy cookie: [Leonardo AI Levels Up With ControlNet & 3D Texture Generation - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasZTz3_Pq0)

  * how i'd use this
    * i think this would mainly be for generating concepts, variations of assets, generating in own personal art style based on my training data, and generating textures
  * what is it similar to?
    * Midjourney
  * features, tech, products
    * [[draw,canvas to image]]
