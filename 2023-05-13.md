  * [[creator journal, creative, tracking]]
    * Seems like i want ShmojiCodes to be more of my HOW TO channel. (details important - computation). Tutorial channel. People go there to figure out how to do stuff or maybe even to keep up to date with latest tech. 
    * The LibOfCreations channel will be more of a WHAT IS channel. (details not as important - summary/interface into huge concepts to get idea of what it is). We share creations. This is for people that find the content interesting, not really someone looking how to do something. Maybe for people that want to learn about some thing. About what the thing is, but not details on HOW TO use it. 
    * Also, maybe will rename ShmojiCodes to ShmojiTutorials or something else one day - doesnt need to just be about coding
