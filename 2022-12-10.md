    * Last night i woke up and from left chest down to left fingers it was going numb and painful 3/10. I had this feeling like 1-3 times ever and it was over a year ago. So this is rare. What caused it??
    * Around 8pm, had a tiny bit of same numbness in hand. Randomly while laying in bed, my right foot went numb like I'd been sitting on it for 30 minutes or something.
