    * tracking story as i watch
      * [[2024-07-25]]
        * school of kids. one commits suicide, randomly students start getting emails from dead classmate. Lain seems to see dead classmate with her eyes for a second
        * Lain sees a lot of pschadelic stuff all the time for some reason and messages appear on screen often which im pretty sure she sees. One says something about the "wired"
        * bro what. They go to club Cyberia and shooter kills people. Lain stares at shooter, walks at him as he says he wants out, and Lain says everyone is connected and he shoots self in head
        * Bashooke randomly appears in Lain's locker
        * people keep saying they know Lain and she has completely opposite personality other times They say they saw her in the Wire
        * random cia agent looking dudes following Lain
        * her dad wouldn't say what bashooke was
        * on bus she's randomly hearing voices
      * [[2024-07-26]]
        * Lain's sister randomly shows up and then not much else comes of it
        * Lain's dad says the Wired is separate from real life. She says boundaries arent so clear and says she'll fully go in the Wired (bc modified Navi OS using Bashooke)
        * Lain's mom: maybe the Wired originates from elsewhere into electrical signals of the Wired (the internet) and then physical reality is hologram of this info originating from the Wired. But somehow this hologram that is less evolved and lower dimensional is for verification of existence...
        * Lain's dad: maybe the Internet we created as society birthed a new real world. Then says something about embodied God living in the Wired. Maybe showing self through prophecies
      * [[2024-07-27]]
        * apparently the Knights put parasite bomb in Lain's coolant system of Navi and the guys with red laser lights on head are not the Knights
        * there was some scientist that built system that extracted psi or intuition from kids and gathered the energy or something. But then he stopped it, but someone found this and upgraded it so system could extract intuition from kids from anywhere without head strap
        * scientist said something about Lain having rogues that maintains kid's emulations...or something like that...i didnt get it. Maybe he's talking about the ones sucking out their souls
        * Lain's older sis looked ded, wonder if system was sucking out her soul too - the mom kinda seemed same
        * yo is it saying that prayer is the way this system sucks the psi out of kids? is it forced? maybe find out later on.
      * [[2024-07-29]]
        * it seemed this episode has actual history about Memex, Xanadu, hypertext, some UFO incident in 1940s, NASA people, etc
        * it mentioned the Schuman resonance and some guy that did something with his protocol at that resonance - and then got killed just after. EDIT: he encoded Shuman resonance into 7th gen Wired protocol on his own time. At very end of episode, it looks like you see this dead guy with Lain...
        * apparently the Knights are trying to make the only truth there is into reality...or something bc in wired it's hard to figure out what is true - Lain finds this out from boy in club (JJ's place) who she thought was part of the Knights but he isnt formally
      * [[2024-07-30]]
        * i think love episode implies Lain was created by Eijiro guy that encoded something in Wired protocol and then got killed. Even see her Dad leave. So did she actually have real human body? 
        * thoughts on the collective unconscious
        * apparently Lain locates all members of Knights and then group with lasers on heads kills them all. Apparently they get rid of whatever he encoded in protocol too (which almost just felt like belief in him or what he stood for as a God idk - bc a God requires worship/belief to exist). cant remember exactly, but those guys mentioned that Wired couldn't become indistinguishable from real world or something like that
        * apparently Lain put emulation of Navi into her head. Then "god guy" says she will overflow and says she is executable software not hardware.
        * Lain erases memories of her fren Alice being into that teacher from everyone which freaks Alice out
      * [[2024-07-31]]
        * well shoot it seems the laser guys' client actually wanted to connect real world with the Wired WITHOUT need for any device - which i thought that was opposite of what he wanted (thought that was goal of the Knights...but maybe he was actually controlling Knights from beginning idk). Two laser guys die it seems and looks like Lain did it which is confusing
        * watched final episode. Ego. It seemed like scary thing happened with Eiri where he was manifesting a body bc he got angry with Lain provoking him about having no body. Then it freaked Alice out and she was traumatized and hating Lain about it for some reason.
        * Then it seemed like Lain deletes everyone's memory of her.
        * it's weird to think she deleted other people's memories
        * Lain mostly lives in the Wired, but partially in real world. Something mentioned about the Wired connecting to something else that is the "real world". "network is a field to pass along info. info doesnt ever stand still - it's always in motion. do you think humans could create something to store info that vast? the Wired is connect to the thing that can do that - the real world"
        * feels like it ended with Lain realizing all memories/data are connected from all realities - past present and future. it showed Lain interacting with Alice in reality where Alice is older and with that teacher. showed Lain with her dad. Were these all just from her mind or....i have no idea
      * [[2024-08-01]]
        * just watching explainYT vids now
        * seems Lain was entity born with the Wired as a sort of omnipresent being. When Eiri killed himself he somehow became one with Wired. Maybe protocol he put in Wired allowed it. This protocol i think is what turned Lain into a person in the Wired by using the Schuman resonance. After Eiri dies, he uses synthetic biology to create Lain with a body. Eiri was trying to use Lain in order to destroy barrier between the Wired and real world
        * it seems Eiri erased tons of memories somehow, placed Lain with fake family and frens, and controlled the Knights, and client with laser guys who also wanted to destroy barrier. He also sets up many events so Lain with body is curious in the Wired and finds home there in hopes she will be one to break barrier since she exists in both
        * oo interesting, it seems Mikka went crazy bc the Knights were attacking her and distorting her reality
      * [[2024-08-02]]
        * oo interesting - Lain is basically similar to story of God and Jesus
