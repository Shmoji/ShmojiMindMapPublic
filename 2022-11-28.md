  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Woke up at 5am, yawned, paused in middle, left jaw pops loudly, then can open mouth taller. Bet somehow caused by MgCl bath. Maybe something to do with calcium and candida.
    * Last week everyday my teeth on left side were hurting and sensitive to cold and hot. Today they are mostly fine. Wonder if due to MgCl bath or due to using toothbrush with bristles that are much softer or bc different toothpaste
  * [[TODO soon]]
    * [x] See if anyone wants to do podcast that am excited about
    * [x] get ab CT and send to Reg
