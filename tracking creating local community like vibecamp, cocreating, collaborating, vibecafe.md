      * met with Karen who created successful local meetup for ai
      * her keys were consistency and alignment/consistency around the mission/values
      * what value are you giving and what value you are getting - is that consistent?
      * i have this ai discord for triangle and i want to create some sort of local vc meetup thing. Karen mentioned it's important to figure out precisely what this community is. And i really dont know. Bc like, i didnt even know how to explain vibecamp either when she asked me to explain. It was hard for me to explain what value i even got out of it aside from "connection" which didnt feel like a good answer for some reason
      * maybe useful to talk with vc creators and Victor about this - and mention ai discord, and using river
      * Just had profound thought: LOCAL MINDMAPPING

  * tracking thoughts on what this is
    * [[2024-04-05]]
      * just more ponderings: local makerspace/computer lab/C4 lobby (like in college)
      * you can emote subtle signals to others. can sub to whole room or others
      * parallel play, co-creation, coworking, vibing, connecting, be heard, listen
      * how can i do this if im becoming a nomad?
        * guess i could do at Akiya and in VibeCafe
        * maybe still in Triangle and couch surf with frens

      * pondering on actually making vibecamp event and how to do it. i feel like this is crucial: [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/tracking creating local community like vibecamp, cocreating, collaborating, vibecafe#^Wi3_QvCZU|PARALLEL PLAY is crucial]]
      * so im thinking a 1-x hour event that creates container for parallel play. At beginning i will tell eveyone parallel play is the point and to just do whatever they want (in description of event can tell people to come prepared to do whatever they want - like play video games or read book)
      * but then ill also tell everyone there are 2 optional roles this container allows - 1) person that wants to be heard, has some desire needs help with, or just needs help 2) people willing to help or listen
      * to partake in the process of being heard and listening, you gotta use some app for signaling stuff
      * maybe at end of event we can see if anyone used app. if not, can ask if anything else emerged from the event
      * tbh i can prob do this same thing in vibecafe

  * questions for myself
    * currently, what does the container im trying to create look like?
      * idea 1 - parallel ^vnATy1I9K
        * PARALLEL PLAY is crucial ^Wi3_QvCZU
        * before container starts, rules
          * PLANS: list what you plan to do during container if you have plans. you dont need plans
          * REACHING OUT: list how you feel about people contacting you during this container. Vocally? Over message? Not at all?
          * CAN JOIN?: list this: can people join you in whatever you are doing? if so, how? JOINABLE PEOPLE
          * NEED HELP? DESIRES?: list: anything you need help with or any desires on your mind or that come up. THINGS PEOPLE NEED HELP WITH AND DESIRES
          * HELPER?: list: if you are willing to help others or try to help or at least offer an ear to listen. HELPERS
        * questions
          * where do people list the stuff above for everyone to see? what needs to be displayed for every person?
            * button to show all people. Then can click each person to see their details (maybe some indicators of different things about them even before this point). Maybe some categories before even getting to actual people. Like separating based on who is willing to help vs who is not. Or who is joinable and who is not
            * list of posts of what people need help with and list of posts of desires people have (maybe different lists or maybe same - idk)
      * idea 2 - optional silent-convo ^WM-SqDzag
        * normal convo as usual except before container starts everyone is made aware of tool where during or after convo you can write down things you wanted to share, but didnt get the chance to. Anyone that wants to stay later, can then go back and share what was missed and people can listen
        * if no one stays to listen, at least 1 or more container leaders will be there to listen
        * if in middle of convo isnt that lively, can even ask people if they have anything they've written down and havent shared yet aloud
        * [[ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/ShmojiMindMapPublic-2025-05-24-12-15-07_cleaned/hugz project, emote, symbol fun#^YT8rJZKfo|tracking optional silent-convo context]]
    * what do i want to create in terms of a local community?
      * PARALLEL PLAY is crucial
        * i want to be able to go somewhere and do my own individual thing, but BE around other people that are frens - sorta like a fren coffee shop
        * even better if frens that are there happen to be able to give advice when you need it
        * i would love if i could go to meetup when EXTREMELY BUSY and still keep working, OR also go there when i just wanna vibe, talk, cuddle, etc

  * local project ideas
    * non-verbal meetup: https://lu.ma/ozm1bzrm
