  * key points
    * protocol that enables interoperability between blockchains
    * replaces bridges, which get complex and many security issues
  * my first impressions
    * this is crucial tech (inevitable) and seems to have decentralized fundamentals
    * watched team at work trade tokens from 1 blockchain to other very quickly using cosmos
  * questions
    * is protocol built on a cosmos smart contract platform? like how dat work?
    * is this technology actually decentralized? if not, which pieces of it is not?
