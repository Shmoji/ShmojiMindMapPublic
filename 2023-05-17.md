    * Despite avoiding lemon juice, still have 2/10 gum pain on left side - also it's randomly on right side too...weird!! If avoiding lemon juice doesnt work, gonna try swishing with coconut oil eventually
    * Woke up with 3-4/10 heavy-feeling kidneys. Possible reasons why: 1) some reason oxalates are high and cause feeling 2) recently introduced lot of iodized salt and maybe related 3) i went on run for first time in months, maybe related
