  * [[Shmoji Podcast episodes]]
  * Random observations
    * in 1st poddy, i just couldnt think of more and more questions and i didnt have any written down. So it made it hard to continue convo with James and dive deep. Made lots of awk moments
    * in 2nd poddy, i put too much of my own input into poddy and the focus was too much on me. I could have instead asked more questions to Mike and tried to dive deep in things in his mind space. But i have no idea what people will be confident in before poddy, so how do i come up with questions?
  * Podcast ideas
    * First idea for podcast
      * Places to improve
        * I dont need to be part of convo really. I barely even need to talk. Just ask questions and they dont even need to be that good. I realized this after watching Ocean podcast
      * Questions for myself
        * Is it important to find out guest's topic early and research it so i can challenge from smart standpoint? Or should i challenge from a non-knowledgeable standpoint?
          * I think most people won't be experts on most topics, so seeing from the perspective where im not an expert could be incredibly valuable.
        * Will research during podcast take too long?
          * Answer: i think so, but I'm still open
        * I think i want my guests to choose the topic because i want it to be a topic they are super confident in and WANT to talk about. If i choose the topic, then they may not be super confident in it, so it ruins it. It helps if the topic they are confident in is also something that is polarized.
        * If i challenge a stupid point, htat is stupid. So i need to challenge a point that is not completely known in regards to that topic. Or something that is very polarized. Maybe I can ask them what aspect of X is polarized or what aspect is not completely known, if it is not obvious after listening to them.
