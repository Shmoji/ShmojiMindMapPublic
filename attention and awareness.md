      * Attention: This refers to the selective focus on particular information while ignoring other stimuli. It's an active process where you direct your cognitive resources towards a specific stimulus. For instance, while reading this answer, you are paying attention to the text and potentially ignoring other stimuli in your environment.
      * Awareness: This is the state or ability to perceive, feel, or be conscious of events, objects, or sensory patterns. It's a broader concept than attention. You can be aware of something without necessarily paying focused attention to it.
      * Scope:
        * Attention: It is narrow in scope. When you pay attention to something, you often do so at the expense of other stimuli, due to the limited cognitive resources we have.
        * Awareness: It has a broader scope. You can be aware of various things in your peripheral perception without actively focusing on them.
      * Consciousness:
        * Attention: This is a mechanism or process within consciousness. It's the act of directing your consciousness or focus towards specific stimuli.
        * Awareness: This is more synonymous with consciousness itself. For example, in discussions about the nature of consciousness, being "aware" and being "conscious" are often used interchangeably.
      * Control:
        * Attention: Can be both voluntary (e.g., focusing on a task at hand) and involuntary (e.g., a loud noise grabbing your attention).
        * Awareness: Often occurs without conscious control. For instance, you might become aware of a feeling of hunger or a sensation of cold without actively trying to focus on it.
      * Examples:
        * Attention: You're watching a movie and focusing on the main characters, ignoring background details.
        * Awareness: While watching the same movie, you're conscious of the room temperature, the feel of the couch beneath you, and the dimmed lights, even if you aren't actively focusing on them.

    * ROOTLESS AWARENESS: often people call it empty awareness, but i think this is better. You are subject to awareness. IT happens to you whether you like it or not. But if you turn attention back on itself, there is nothing. No subject. No source. Self-existing.
