  * my main shmoji account
    * content of mine people like
      * clips from content i consume that really stuck out to me - like Breedlove clip (or maybe one high status person liked it and that just boosted it - so people dont really like it, just a status thing)
        * number times this was signaled to be what my audience likes: 2
      * people like stuff about consciousness and questioning reality
      * surprisingly people like updates on my health (or maybe i just worded one post really well)
    * content of mine people dont like
      * long videos talking about personal experiences. Or maybe people just dont care about a story about me fixing my panic attacks. i wouldn't either lmao - 8 minutes of someone else's story? screw that
    * why do i want to post on my MAIN?
      * to post novel thoughts that pop in my head
        * novelty is fun
      * to post patterns i observe
        * posting a pattern helps me remember it more than not posting it
        * patterns are fun to notice
      * to get responses to my posts
        * i think i want this bc i want niche responses about whatever is currently on my mind
          * i think i want this bc i like interacting with other people, especially about niche things currently on my mind

      * questions
        * do i want to post absolutely anything on my MAIN or are there some things i dont want to post on there?
          * brainstorming
            * it's much easier for people i know i dont want to see everything to find my main
              * why dont i want certain people to see every single side of me?
                * maybe one day i want to post a bunch of stuff related to sex with my partner. Dont really want family to see that. It's just weird
                  * so i can post everything on the alt account. If weirded out people want to sign up for that then they can.
                  * Maybe above point is backwards. Maybe i should recommend people that get weirded out to not follow my main account. I can just create an account specifically for family or something
  * EvilShmoji account
    * 2024
      * i post anything i want here and dont consider my audience
      * im not trying to be an artist here so dont need to worry about spamming here and for same reason dont need to cater content for audience. i spam as much as i want to without a care

  * whyspia
    * 2024
      * seems to be a place where my soul resides in. so i post content that feels soulful
      * partially feels like it's meant to be content that is from me, but is so soulful that it's not about me if that makes sense
      * for that reason, i would also post other people's content if they wanted if it resonated with my soul (like a guardin song)
    * [[2025-02-10]]
      * for the X account, errthing i said b4 still resonates. but whyspia is more like a universe (1). The X account is more like my creative content i am proud of (2). and another different thing is the HOME i am trying to find/build (hopefully with others) (3). I wouldnt want 3 to be an account of just my own passionate creations. 
      * whyspia: haven for finding alignment
      * my soulful/passionate creations:
      * HOME im finding/building: sanctuary for shared whispers of the soul to echo in flux
      * Q: what is the X community? A: iz prob closer to whyspia universe. Haven for finding alignment. Helping others. I think OG most ppl there just interested in the tech

  * questions
    * i have account for posting pure soulful art, i have one for posting my thoughts with some curation, and one for posting spam - i feel i need account for posting partially soulful content. Where?
      * have just been putting on shmojii, but most of it gets lost in all my other posts hmmm
      * even if i created account for this, i have so much content like this that is different, should i even put it together? ex: video game clips and then my stories
