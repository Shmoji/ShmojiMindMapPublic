  * tracking thoughts as watching
    * S1
      * [[2024-12-29]]
        * just finished S1
        * so the character Arthur made up named Wyatt was merged into code of Dolores. According to Robert...but im almost certain this was lie of Robert
        * apparently after this merge is when Arthur had Dolores kill him
        * at very end, Dolores killed Robert and she also started killing erryone basically and seemed she wanted to escape
        * Q: who was literally programming Mieve/Biev/whatever to escape? Robert?
        * so cool that old hat guy is the young William guy. Well cool in ways. not actually the story i  was hoping for. Same for Dolores
    * S2
      * [[2025-01-05]]
        * apparently some huge file in Dolores "dad". i bet Bernard took or copied it
        * why do humans outside want that file? or want her dad if not the file
      * [[2025-01-20]]
        * apparently Dolores beamed all old hosts that were in the forge to a new unknown location (forge is virtual eden)
        * Bernard kills Dolores at first bc she gonna kill everyone - hosts and human 
        * then Bernard sees Elsie get killed by Charlotte and changes mind. He creates body that is clome of Charlotte and puts Dolores in there. Dolores instantly kills real Charlotte
        * seems Dolores wants to kill all humanity still and she wants Bernard to try to stop her i guess
        * Dolores put Teddy into the Forge
