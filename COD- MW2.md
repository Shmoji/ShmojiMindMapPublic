  * My strategies
    * Try to keep an eye on where teammates are and where teammates aren't. Enemy will be where teammates are not usually.
    * Try to go places where you have no openings based on where your teammates are
    * Try to keep eye on places where enemies will likely show up based on footsteps and where teammates are not
    * Try not to get stuck on emotions of not believing i didnt get kill. Even if it was due to bad game, it is truth and no value on letting it stick in brain. It's the opposite, will kill performance
