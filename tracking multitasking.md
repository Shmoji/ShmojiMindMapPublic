  * tracking multitasking social-stuff and some other thing at same time
    * tracking trying to game while hanging out with someone

        * tried playing nier automata while sitting there with dad. kept getting interrupted to listen/talk and missed important story/dialogue. if during combat part, then a lil more okay
        * was also hot and sweaty in garden room which made experience suck
        * i think at least for this game i prefer to be jacked in and only focused on game - with no distractions
