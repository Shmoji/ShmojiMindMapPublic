    * [[2024-10-26]] ilia Topuria vs Max Holloway, knockdown vs takedown #[[fast memo]]
      * Holloway had never been knocked down before and been in UFC since 20 years old and he's around 32 now
      * well he got knocked out by Topuria
      * knockdown and takedown ^_qsCeGCoz
        * knockdown is a strike causes damage so much that footing is lost and they fall. Finish maybe incoming
        * takedown is to gain control or positional advantage
      * Topuria lives in and fights for Spain - born in Germany and moved while young and he began fighting in Georgia. Think he’s around 27 and looked up to Holloway for long time. He only joined UFC in 2020. Apparently bc he’s one of only Spanish fighters, his country gives him big money - he has million dollar gym built into his house and been traveling with other sports teams
      * Holloway fights for Hawaii USA
