  * what is it?
    * mtcapra: Colostrum is the thick fluid which is produced as a precursor to mother’s milk. It is found in humans, goats, and other mammals where it is produced by the mother for two days following birth. Colostrum can be described as a brilliantly designed IMMUNE SYSTEM DELIVERY PROTOCOL, which effectively “jump starts” a newborn’s undeveloped immune system. Mt. Capra’s Goat Milk Colostrum is unique because it comes from goats, which means it is from a source that is biologically closer to human milk than the mass produced bovine (cow) colostrum.
    * mtcapra: Colostrum supplies the body with immune factors and is easily tolerated by most. Colostrum has dozens of health related components, the primary being immune related. Colostrum is made up of various macro and micro constituents such as cytokines, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, etc. These components have various biological roles. For example:
      * **Cytokines:** Cytokines are part of our systemic immune system. These proteins keep communication between immune cells active. “No communication = No immunity”
      * **Immunoglobulins** (IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, IgM) Immunoglobulins are also known as antibodies. These small proteins are used by the immune system to seek out and destroy foreign antigens (invaders).
      * **Lactoferrin**: Assists with iron absorption and has shown anti-microbial characteristics. It is also part of our immune system.
  * what do people think?
    * Grim and his community seem to be bullish on it - but is it a one-off thing or a continuous thing?
    * CIRS discord feels same as Grim
  * questions
    * how to take and how often?
      * mtcapra: Take 2-4 capsules (1450-2900 mg.) (ill go with 2) twice daily, on empty stomach for 90 days.
    * CAN I MIX THE COLOSTRUM INTO A HOT DRINK OR FOOD?
      * No, we don’t recommend this. At hotter temperatures the immunoglobulins start to denature and won’t make the colostrum as effective.
    * HOW FAR DO I HAVE TO TAKE THIS AWAY FROM FOOD TO BE ON AN EMPTY STOMACH?
      * 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after a meal is considered an empty stomach.
    * DOES THIS COLOSTRUM NEED TO BE REFRIGERATED?
      * mtcapra: No. Our Goat Milk Colostrum is shelf-stable and does not need to be refrigerated. Just keep the lid tightly on between uses and store in a dry place. It will remain good even after opening through the best by date on the bottom of the bottle.
    * where to buy?
      * GRIMCORD: they recommended Mt. Capra goat colostrum
      * multiple people in Cirs discord recommend from Equip. A few recommended ARMRA or whatevs, but some said that one no good bc they advertise a lot
