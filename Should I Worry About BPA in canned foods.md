  * **General Notes**
    * BPA stands for bisphenol A, an industrial chemical that has been used to make certain plastics and resins since the 1950s.
    * BPA is common in **epoxy-resin linings** of **metal **food cans.  The epoxy lining forms a **barrier **between the metal and the food which helps create a **seal**.  This seal prevents corrosion and, thus, keeps the food safe from bacterial contamination and metallic taste.
    * BPA may be harmful. But alternatives may be too AND alternatives do not need to be labeled on cans
  * **Actions to avoid BPA and other harmful toxins from cans**
    * Whenever possible, substitute **fresh**, **frozen **or **dried **food for canned food
    * If a product isn't labeled BPA-free, keep in mind that some, but not all, plastics marked with recycle code **3** or **7** may contain BPA.
    * The only lining that BLOGGER is relatively comfortable recommending is **oleoresinous enamel**.  It is a mixture of oil and resin extracted from plants such as pine and balsam fir.  To my knowledge, **Eden Foods** is the only company that uses oleoresinous enamel cans.  However, oleoresinous e-enamel lining does not work for highly acidic foods, such as tomatoes. ME: i see no evidence their alternative is better
