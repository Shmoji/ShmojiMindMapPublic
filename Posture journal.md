      * Was trying to sit up straight, but it hurts like crazy. Noticed my hand is always on the mouse. Looked and saw my elbow was always way in front of me due to mouse. If i scooched chair forward so that hand can stay on mouse, but my elbow is now to side of my body, my pain decreases a lot. Still pain there tho.

      * Noticed when my legs are up like L or criss cross in chair, i have much less pain in back and neck

      * noticed back was hurting (i think lower back) when standing at standing desk for long time. Then, i got in car and back felt good in that position where im almost sitting straight and knees are slightly up (compared to in chair where knees are not slightly up - they are at 90 degrees).

      * i noticed while standing i think lower back starts hurting and feeling pressure when the pressure is incorrectly going there. It seems the pressure should be going to my hips and thighs - i say this bc it seems like if i transfer pressure to hips and legs then pressure releases from lower back - but this is all speculative.

      * woke up and immediately started working at standing desk. after like 5-10 minutes my lower back hurt enough where i had to sit down. uncertain if just from standing or also related to having arms forward typing and using mouse
  * tracking when upper back hurts

      * when im standing and using keyboard or mouse my upper back near shoulder blades almost always hurts - more like a nagging pain that i can always handle tho. feel this from top-back corners of shoulders to back line of upper back. Maybe goes up to join neck pain too?
