	  * what does x thing SYMBOLIZE? ex: Japan, repulsion to do work, wanting a more permanent community
	  * sunriseoath: can your work be play?
		* in response to me:
		  * i always struggle with excess "dopamine" bleeding where it shouldnt be. Overeating. Lust. Comfort. Play.
		  * i think this is why i sometimes struggle to start working on things. i feel a huge feeling of repulsion towards doing work bc id much rather play
		  * historically, i always bypassed this by beating myself up and forcing myself day after day to do stuff against the repulsion feeling. But i could sense this wasnt right. But not doing things isnt right either
		  * still havent figured out how to break this loop

	  * was thinking on how it sucks you learn so much and never use it. well how can you? mostly just in convos talking about it. but so what? what else could you do to finally use all that hidden knowledge? not a job, that just locks you into one thing
	  * what resonates: i like idea of turning all these knowledge symbols into places - making/building stuff for each one. like how you store stuff in mind map except it's maybe more artsy bc it's a place for each thing (life or potential for life is important in these places)
	  * maybe i could just create a place that resonates with me. like the old Meez emo locations. Or i could create places for stuff learned like Lorentz Force - altho that sounds harder lol
	  * hmm i feel websim could be useful here
	- [[2024-11-23]] vibing with: contrast, representing same thing #[[fast memo]]
	  * really been vibing with:
	  * 1) contrast
	  * 2) representing the same thing using totally different models
	  * would love to actually apply these to something i create...but no idea if right now is the moment for that...sadly

	  * Masami the artist i listened to at Impact Hub in Tokyo really resonated and then it resonated that i wanted to express whyspia through art like that...but not really sure how aside from like pics of people doing basic stuff lol

	  * "not coworking. doing what you want." - inspired by Reading Rhythms motto. i like it; via negativa always seems to be most powerful
	  * what if i pivoted and just made a video game...but it incorporates everything im already doing...will ppnder more on dis. ooo an app where you open it and that's it...aside from tracking how long youve been there total, current session, etc. AND MOST OF ALL it tells you how many people there RIGHT NOW. minimum viable presence. Which then can build on that so people can start creating organized spaces for this same thing. Public and private ones. Eventually move to the physical with the same concept
	  * making whyspia app for people saying where they are coworking, when, how long, inviting others to join - privacy features and whatnot

		- what if i pivoted and just made a video game...but it incorporates everything im already doing
		- create minimal Rainbows End tech for my NOT coworking meetups + frens/fam + OS
		- Once that is done, start working on a place that is literally a video game. Hyperfy will prob get involved.
