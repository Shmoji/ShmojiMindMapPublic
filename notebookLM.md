  * questions
    * what difference in source and note?
      * technically idk, but it seems notes are temporary and not focus - but can be included into context window. Whereas sources are the focus
      * my best guess is that sources are RAG and notes are just english prompts maybe??
    * how it doing it behind scenes?
      * RAG im like 90% sure
    * how many words per source and how many sources?
      * 20 sources with 200,000 words per source
