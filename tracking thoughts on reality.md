      * 1) did our reality originate from a mind or something more mechanical? like imagine some future person tracks it all the way back to an origin point
2) is our reality sustained by a mind or something more mechanical? so we tracked the origin of our reality - if we get rid of it will that also destroy our reality? are we dependent on some super-mind? are we dependent on some super mechanical system? are we only dependent on ourselves and our own reality? are we self-sustaining? what's the difference in internal and external?
3) a mix or something else
      * and maybe we find out minds are mechanical. But then that means you can continue tracing back in time if enough information was tracked. But the original question for 1 is more about whether mind came first or something mechanical/mathematical came first
