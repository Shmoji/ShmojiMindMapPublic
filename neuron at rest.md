  * what is key to know?
    * neuron at rest is not sending signals
    * Concentration of Sodium ions is higher outside cell than inside. The relative concentration of Potassium ions is opposite of last sentence. This ionic separation occurs right at cell membrane and causes CHEMICAL gradient across membrane. More positively charged ions outside cell which causes ELECTRICAL gradient. Both gradients combined are referred to as electrochemical gradient
    * Difference in total charge inside and outside cell is called **cell membrane potential. **At rest CMP=-70millivolts. <-this means the inside of cell is ~70millivolts less positive than outside.
    * At rest, Inside of cell has net negative charge, outside has net positive charge. Charges align on cell membrane and bulk solution on either side is electrically neutral
    * Ions cannot move across membrane at will. They need **protein** embedded in membrane to facilitate their movement.
    * Most ions cross membrane through structure called [[ion channel]]. Ions move through them by **passive diffusion **along their concentration gradient. Some ion channels are always open, but many require signal to tell them to open or close
