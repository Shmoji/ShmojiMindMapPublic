    * Today felt like 9/10 bad. Pain on entire head with strong neuralgia head pains in certain areas. Almost felt like fainting in demo room. So much mucus draining. Lots of sinus and jaw pain. Pain all over body (weak and achy muscles). Possible reasons why: 1) had cod liver for first time in forever last night 2) ate cookie (but i do that occasionally and doesn't do this to me and felt it before cookie) 3) intermittent fasting maybe isn't great for me, but i doubt it. 
    * With the above, i think sodium helped. i day this because i ate salmon and still felt ass. Ate banana - ass. Ate popcorn and felt a bit better.
