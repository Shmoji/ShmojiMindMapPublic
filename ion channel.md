  * what is it?
    * Ions cannot move across cell membrane at will. They need **protein** embedded in membrane to facilitate their movement. Most ions cross membrane through structure called ion channel. Ions move through them by **passive diffusion **along their concentration gradient. Some ion channels are always open, but many require signal to tell them to open or close
    * Most ion channels are selectively permeable, meaning they only allow one or a small subset of ions to pass through
  * types of ion channels
    * **Voltage-Gated Channel** ^U1PlrvpDp
      * Open when membrane potential reaches certain value
      * Typically only allow single ion to pass through when membrane opens. This means we need separate channels for each ion. Ex: VG sodium channel, VG potassium channel, etc
    * **Ligand-Gated Channel**
      * Triggered to open when bound by a specific molecule
    * **Mechanically-Gated Channel**
      * Open in response to physical forces such as changes in length or changes in pressure
