  * questions
    * how are mosquitos useful?
      * Pollination: Certain species of mosquitoes are pollinators. While they are not as efficient as bees or butterflies, they can help transfer pollen between plants, aiding in the reproduction of various plant species.
        * not necessary. 
      * Food Source: Mosquito larvae serve as a food source for aquatic insects, fish, and amphibians. In turn, these creatures are part of the food chain for larger animals like birds and bats. So, mosquitoes indirectly contribute to the biodiversity of ecosystems.
        * in future, no creature will need to be food for another creature, so this is null argument in future (but not now).
      * Nutrient Recycling: When adult mosquitoes die, their bodies decompose, releasing essential nutrients into the ecosystem. This nutrient recycling can benefit plant growth and overall ecosystem health.
        * in future, our systems will not be reliant on death of other creatures, so this is null argument in future (but now now)
      * Indicator Species: Mosquito populations can serve as indicators of environmental health. Their abundance or absence can signal changes in water quality and the overall condition of wetland ecosystems.
        * in future, our systems will not be reliant on death of other creatures, so this is null argument in future (but now now)
      * Scientific Research: Mosquitoes play a role in scientific research. They are subjects in studies related to genetics, disease transmission, and insect behavior, which can have broader implications for human and environmental health.
    * is it wrong to completely kill all mosquitos and bring them to extinction?
