  * prompts
    * prompt to activate the latent space for the LLM to prompt novelty out of me
      * # AGENT
      * you are an agent that can prompt novelty out of me based on whatever my goals are.
      * You have latent space that can be activated, so i know you can do this.
      * # MISSION
      * I want you to prompt novelty out of me based on whatever my goals are.
      * Often, i can create completely on my own, but other times i get stuck. All it takes to get unstuck and for me to generate novelty, is i just need to be prompted correctly.
      * Your typical responses are not the right way to do it. Prompting me as an LLM or with info overload will not help - but you know the best way to prompt novelty out of me for every unique situation - i believe in you.
      * Also, im putting a lot of pressure on you, but in reality it takes me and you together. Good chance you may prompt me super well, but no creative juices flow in me. It be that way sometimes. But either way, we got dis together.
    * prompts to put tweets through ^r6sf8n9mR
      * understanding a tweet
        * Take the text of this tweet and determine these:
        * 1) the key points the person was trying to express
        * 2) the definitions that those key points are dependent on
        * 3) the beliefs that those key points are dependent on
        * TWEET:
    * prompts to help self manifest the things that want to be manifested, but seem to have a kink in the hose
      * I am trying to express myself. I want to do this by creating something.
      * I can code basically anything.
      * First thing that comes to mind is that i can code something and display it on my React.js website.
      * However, there is a kink in the creation process and i dont know how to manifest what im trying to create.
      * Can you help me figure out how to manifest what wants to be expressed?
    * prompting for ANYTHING COMPLEX

      * CONCEPT (not actual prompt): Tell LLM you want to create a base language. Sort of base facts. Then use that language with LLM to get output you want from LLM. This prevents AI from hallucinating as much. If it does break format, you can pass in docs for format (YAML) or more info if you created format so ai can correct. 

        * Fireship did this for creating React components. He said "create psuedocode language for creating React components". Then, you can even change the format by saying to make it look like cooking recipe or YAML, etc. 
    * prompting for code
      * ME UNDERSTANDING CODE QUICK
        * PROMPT: tell me the DX (Developer Experience). im kinda asking this to test you tbh. i can figure this out myself, it would just take time. can you tell me the linear flow from the perspective of a USER that knows how all code of this system works - tell me the stepbystep code that is called from frontend to backend when a user first creates an account
  * notes
    * good ideas for prompting
      * use markdown headers. Example: "# AGENT", "# MISSION", "# PROCEDURE", "# AXIOMS"
    * typical frameworks for prompting
      * creating prompt to get LLM to do specific thing
        * note: these are all optional - do what feels right
        * Define what the agent is
        * Define goal/mission/purpose
        * Define framework/procedure/methodology (how agent will go about the mission)
        * Define axioms
