    * GOOD DAY. today i felt better than i have in MONTHS. I got really good sleep for some reason even tho went to bed late. Maybe Rapaport's experiment is working!! Will keep tracking
    * Coming back to write about how good i felt this day. It was bizarre and rare. I felt like i needed to exercise bc all the extra physical energy i had. My mood felt invincible. I got so much more done and wasnt even exhausted at end of day.
  * [[creator journal, creative, tracking]]
    * when creating open sourcing data video, the first 2 tries/scripts were just boring and didnt feel right. This surprised me bc i followed the steps that worked of last video. I first wrote out key points and then i tried writing it like a story of how i experienced it
    * i think it's possible that story wasnt interesting. i was def struggling to even remember the story, which made it not fun for me
    * i found i kept trying to overexplain and this is what made the script suck for me as the creator and for the content consumer
    * For the third try, i said this: "Try writing exactly what i am going to do for this experiment instead of explaining the thought process and see if that ends up better" - and it worked. Created it in a flow state and it was great. I was writing exactly about the fun stuff - the experiment. Maybe a lil bit about motivations and concepts, but only the chewy stuff.
    * Seems like the last draft was good because i took the thoughts in my mind that were high energy and externalized them. and it worked well bc it was linear (but not really a story)
    * other thing i learned: Descript is fcking awesome!
