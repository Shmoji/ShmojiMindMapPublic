        * last 2-4 nights have all been nightmares. possible reasons why: 1) for first time in months had spring koe goat cheese gouda and ate entire thing in one sitting. tum was upsetty and bloated for days after. Maybe this also caused nightmares somehow 2) irl fear due to upcoming surgery spreading to dreams 3) had whole foods chocolate for first time in months, maybe something in choco. maybe due to caffeine
        * one nightmare: was in James house, which was huge and hightech - but there were no lights and it was night - complete dark - and i was lost completely - so scared
        * two nightmare: was in some gigantic house with ai agents running every screen. i seemed like i was put in there unwilling. but i seemed safe, but still bad vibes

        * had mild nightmares last night over and over - kept waking in night bc of it. my best guess: 1) had lots of pork for first time in long time last night

        * Woke multiple times in the night and each time was waking from pretty intense nightmare. Only idea: ate tonnnnn of meatballs in new meatball sotanghon. Do not know the type of meatball, but looked like it had other ingredients like spices and veggies tbh. so my main idea/guess for cause of nightmares and not being able to sleep: BEEF
        * nightmare 1: force to military thing during vacation in mountains by d. nightmare 2: all my teeth just dislodged in my mouth with braces all tangled - in dream the reason for not being able to sleep irl was because of THIS - somehow i didnt even know

	    * Had weird alien/actually human home invader dream last night, pretty intense. The only possible causes: 1) had lots of pork BELLY last night, i went for seconds lol. When i woke up from nightmare i kinda felt pukey too which is rare. 2) had baked potato, i dont think it was da potato
