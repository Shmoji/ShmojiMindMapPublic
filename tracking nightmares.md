      * last 2-4 nights have all been nightmares. possible reasons why: 1) for first time in months had spring koe goat cheese gouda and ate entire thing in one sitting. tum was upsetty and bloated for days after. Maybe this also caused nightmares somehow 2) irl fear due to upcoming surgery spreading to dreams 3) had whole foods chocolate for first time in months, maybe something in choco. maybe due to caffeine
      * one nightmare: was in James house, which was huge and hightech - but there were no lights and it was night - complete dark - and i was lost completely - so scared
      * two nightmare: was in some gigantic house with ai agents running every screen. i seemed like i was put in there unwilling. but i seemed safe, but still bad vibes

      * had mild nightmares last night over and over - kept waking in night bc of it. my best guess: 1) had lots of pork for first time in long time last night
