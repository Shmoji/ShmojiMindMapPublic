  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * for past 1-2 weeks i get dry throat randomly on and off. Thought i was sick, but i think may be caused by heating.
    * Dont have enough data to check yet, but i think if i go to sleep with heat on, i wake with dry throat
    * I just turned heat on and seconds later i sneezed for first time in days.
    * left heat on all day. it is now 10pm and throat 4/10 dry - much more than prior in day. I went on run and possible throat got much more dry after that
