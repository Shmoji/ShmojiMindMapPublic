      * had for first time in VERY long. Triggered in night last night. Woke up to pain around 2am. 4/10 intensity, but certain positions get rid of it and some made worse.
      * my only guesses for causes: 1) i slept with ipad pen in bed. i was like 1 percent awake, but at some point i swear it somehow got in my pocket or near crotch and then i moved it to floor. No idea how it could cause entire sack pain tho. 2) yesterday i did several exercises: calf raises with weight, pushups, crunches
      * i noticed standing in one spot slowly causes pain to increase in sack over time - like when brushing teeth
