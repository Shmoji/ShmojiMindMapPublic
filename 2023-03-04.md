  * [[TODO soon-whatiskespingmefromfinishing]]
    * [x] experiment with prompt generation/ storage libs
  * [[Steamship log]]
    * Created template project using this tut: https://alphasec.io/persistent-ai-chat-bots-with-langchain-and-steamship/
    * Can spin up chatbot that persists chat history quickly. But is that persistence just longer and longer concatenated prompt? Does this do what i want? For learn Jap idea or Profile project? Not sure yet. If this doesnt work, i prob need to learn lower level stuff. Gonna try Jap idea with Steamship and go from there

  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * For like a week (maybe more), my throat gets insane dry as it gets later. Right now today at night, so dry it hurts. Wasn't that way earlier today. Not until like 7pm
