  * what is a particle? #memo ^g8P8fUVPm
    * a small localized object to which can be ascribed several physical or chemical properties such as volume, density, or mass. However, in the context of modern physics:
      * **Elementary Particles**: These are the fundamental constituents of matter and cannot be divided into smaller, simpler parts. Examples include:
        * **Quarks**: Components of protons and neutrons.
        * **Leptons**: Like electrons, muons, and taus (each having neutral version called **neutrino** version and charged version).
        * **Bosons**: Particles like photons (light particles), gluons (which mediate the strong force), and the Higgs boson.
      * **Composite Particles**: These are made up of elementary particles. For instance:
        * **Protons and Neutrons**: Made of quarks.
        * **Atoms**: Consisting of protons, neutrons, and electrons.
        * atoms are basically the largest type of particle AND maybe unrelated, but the smallest discrete unit that define chemical elements - num protons in nucleus of atom determine element of atom (6 protons is carbon). EDIT: protons themself don't define an element, but one atom WITH config of protons can
        * although in some contexts ppl may have particles be bigger objects
    * **Behavior**: Particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, a concept known as wave-particle duality, especially evident in quantum mechanics.
    * memo history
      * [[2024-10-16]] today i forgot about neutrons and neutrinos. surpisingly got all bosons and got muons catergory right and electrons. i was on the fence about whether an atom was a particle, but all gud. thought about how molecules seem to stick with energy flow tightly, but particles dont - just speculative thinking tho

        * couldnt remember atom is biggest particle. meme: part...icle. smallest = elementary. biggest = atom...Adam...he big
        * meme to memba types:
          * good fren in elementary school was blq: Bosons, Leptons, Quarks
            * Bosons: higgs has: 1) his own boson 2) photons 3) glue for gluons
            * Leptons: MEN with T-esterone are slepton. which is why they all v ephemeral. Electrons cant be at rest. Muons only in high energy processes like particle accelerators. Neutrinos just fly through you all the time. Taus about same except highest mass of leptons. Generation direction starting from 1: EMT
            * Quarks: up, down, strange, etc
          * composite: com-pare what elementary quark makes up: 1) protons 2) neutrons and what those 2 make up: THE ATOM bb
