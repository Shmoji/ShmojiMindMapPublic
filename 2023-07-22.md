  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * Felt extremely tired all day - like i was falling asleep sitting up and had to try hard to not fall asleep. Also just felt unaligned with self. Tried so many things to fix these things. Didn't work. But then i got on Fortnite with squad and let myself relax. I just slowly slouched down chair and felt myself relax truly and started waking up...so weird. I basically did same before, but it had no effect. Maybe bc i relaxed with friends and bro? Doing it while with others is important maybe? I also started eating dark chocolates at that same moment, so was the cause of true relaxation and realigning with self?

  * [[tracking gum pain issue]]
    * woke up to gum pain about 2-3/10 after it had almost gone away for days. Hmm. Only thing i can think that changed is 1) ate moes meat bowl, Moe's chips, snacks in break room at work
