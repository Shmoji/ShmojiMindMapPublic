  * what is it?
    * AI: spiritual or transcendent experience, often associated with a higher power or a connection to something greater than oneself.
      * this seems more the "that was divine" rather than "the divine"
    * My answer: im a bit split. Idk if it's better to describe this as:

      * 1) something unknown
      * 2) something greater than self
      * 3) something that allows you to see that all is one
      * i also think it's important to differentiate between "that was divine" and "the divine"
        * I think "the divine" = [[spiritual realm]] (or agent from that realm) and "that was divine" describes something that is of the spiritual realm
  * questions
    * does something have to be unknown to be divine?
      * doesnt have to be unknown as a whole, but some part of it  - yes...actually im not sure about this. You can never know everything about anything, so there's always unknowns. But i dont think there has to be huge unknowns - i can experience a simple rock as divine.
      * Good AI quote: It's possible to find divinity in the known and familiar aspects of life as well.
