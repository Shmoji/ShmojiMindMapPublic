    * matteoikari.eth: Brian mainly has 4 features
      * **Perform transactions with a prompt,** eg. “I want to bridge 1 eth from polygon to Ethereum”
      * **Research web3 info,** eg. “Explain the importance of The Graph in the web3 ecosystem”
      * **Deploy smart contracts, **eg. “Deploy an ERC20 with 1000 tokens and name BrianAI”
      * **Research data on The Graph**, eg. “What are the top 3 pools by TVL”
      * We also offer the api to integrate these features into other protocols/applications.
    * me: you can take any publicly verified contract address and then use prompts to call that contract's methods
      * ex: here is USDT contract. Click info icon and can see available methods to call: https://www.brianknows.org/app/contracts/0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7
