  * tracking peeing at night
    * [[2023-09-02]]
      * Yesterday i ate medium amount of chocolate disks from whole foods. I stopped drinking water around 7-8pm. I peed just before bed around 10pm. Big pee. Yet, i still had to wake up in night and big pee again. I am pretty confident it is because of the chocolate. Specifically the caffeine or [[theobromine]]. I wonder which is the larger culprit for these pp symptoms.
      * The above point is about sleepy peeing. I know for a fact i started peeing like crazy after eating chocolates during day. I just found myself surprised bc i thought it would only last a few hours, not all the way into the night.

      * last night i had to wake up in night and pee. Then, i peed like 3 times in morning before even having lunch which is rare. Yesterday i ate shrimp poke bowl, grain silo, chips, and not many chocolates. Super weird
      * also did back workout yesterday late at night, but doubt related
      * also noticed pee smelt very sour - which never happens - wtf did that
      * i also drank some sort of lemon and echidna tea from work (dont know if that's exact name tho)

      * yesterday i peed everytime there was subtle signal body needed too, including 2 times just before sleeping. Also i didnt drink anything after like 7pm
      * yet i woke up twice in night having to pee like crazyyyy
      * i drank Ceylon tea in morning, at noon, and then just my regular non-ceylon drink at 7pm. Barely anything made me pee like a madman. Guess i just have to remember only one cup of ceylon per day in morning

      * everything was mostly normal in terms of drinking water. only diff things: 1) started morning with 1 cup of Roasted Dandelion Root tea. Had like barely any water all day. 2) drank less than half mug of water with my supps around 8-8:30pm
      * so it's either caused by the tea OR by consuming drink too late at night (and maybe bc i consumed too quickly)

      * yesterday i didnt drink any tea. but i did drink my sup with full mug of water around 9 at medium speed - but didnt pee in night or wake up needing to pee bad at all. So i guess tea just really messes me up - even if just one cup in morning? maybe just certain teas?

      * yesterday i had no tea, but i did go on run. Finished last tea right around 8pm. No peeing in night yay. So it's not running causing pee pee. Slightly was thinking that for a while bc it always happened on day i ran

      * i was surprised i woke up to pee in night. My guesses: 1) i had a lil choco but not a lot 2) i had a lot of watermelon, so i bet that's it
      * i finished last tea b4 7pm
      * but same for watermelon, so kinda crazy if it was cause 
      * i peed multiple times before bed, including just before hitting pillow

      * 2 days ago at dinner before 7pm i had soup in tanula and watermelon. This had me waking up to pee despite before 7
      * yesterday had lots of watermelon before 1pm, but no waking up to pee yay

      * first time in a minute. i ran yesterday and didnt even really mess up at all, so kinda confusing. my best guess why: 1) i had roasted dandelion root cup around lunch and drank half of it by 5pm. Then, with my night tea cup around 7pm i used same water with that half cup of tea. took it slow and didnt finish drinking until like 10pm, but i guess since that tea was in there it didnt matter?? 2) ate home-grown cantaloupe
    * [[2024-08-08]]
      * during day been peeing over and over quickly despite drinking typical amount of drank...weird. i did eat some more cantaloupe and a few pears today (not the juice tho)
      * could also be effects of that tea - i think it's known to do something with kidneys
