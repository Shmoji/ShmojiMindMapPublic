* TODO
    * [ ] go through all ARHS boone results in email and record here and in [[all biomarkers ive tested]]
    * [ ] figure out if any of other biomarkers in big list (out of range at some point) need to be in the WORRY list (one right der below)
* NOTES
	* will keep data in my DB and just export data as file and use Code interpreter if ever need to get questions answered about data
* biomarkers that seem to be an issue that can be fixed AND that worry me
    * Lipase high
    * Amylase high

      * 11-8-2022
        * very high
      * notes
        * Possible bowel toxicity due to Beta-alanine production by intestinal bacteria and/or Candida albicans.
        * High beta-Alanine can cause this: "It could be causing high wasting of taurine in the urine, since they compete for the same reabsorption transporters in the kidneys. High taurine levels would verify this." and i do indeed have very high taurine
        * Elevated levels of staphylococcus or streptococcus, use of antibiotics, and breakdown of yeast or fungi in the body can result in increased levels of urinary beta-alanine. Continuously elevated beta-alanine can be detrimental by impairing renal conservation of taurine.
