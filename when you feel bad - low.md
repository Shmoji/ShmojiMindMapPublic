  * thoughts to think
    * You are a warrior. You survived x event. Think about details of that pain and then you surviving it and now sitting there breathing right this moment
    * Leave it to God. 
      * But you are part of God and what if you are the part of God meant to take action after you "leave it to God"? 
        * Then so it will be - that's kinda the point of leaving it to God. You accept any outcome no matter how severe or how good or bad.
      * This can be super nice when you're low because sometimes you will feel like it allows you to stop feeling all the suffering that you are currently feeling. obviously it usually doesn't just stop, but sometimes you'll feel some kind of shift
    * You will beat this for friends and family. Remember the precious moments with each and every one of them
    * You will beat this because there's so much more value you need to offer this world
  * Actions to take
    * If you can, just go jump around. I found when in kidney stone pain, this surprisingly helped a lot...and i didn't even think i could get out of bed and thought doing so would hurt me more. It did hurt me more in some ways, but felt net positive afterwards
      * Jumping around can feel silly and pointless and something about this can be good
      * The physical aspects of it is obviously good
    * Go walk or exercise
    * Pray
      * Maybe you already set every moment to be for prayer, so doing so verbally seems pointless, but that assumption could be wrong.
    * Affirmations
      * Even if you doubt, worth trying. I've seen benefit despite not understanding why
