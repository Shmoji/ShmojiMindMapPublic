  * NOTE: this is a very common thing in my life. I cant make a decision basically - so i just sit and ponder on that internal conflict forever. Usually the only solution is to force myself to do something - which almost feels mean

      * Today i am hesitating to call my dad. I noticed i feel i SHOULD do it, but i dont want to. I want to spend my morning doing my plans. But also this isnt totally true, i do want to call at the same time...or i want to want to call - but i dont actually want to...if that makes sense.
      * Interesting enough, i noticed im also hesitating on the main task i wanna do today - which is converting my DB structure to Ceramic composites. It's the exact same thing. Except different. I really do want to do this one. But i know it's gonna be quite hard. I dont think it's the difficulty that is making me hesitate. I think it might be the next note actually. Although, i do hesitate on a task if i have to ponder on whether i have enough time for that task. Which is basically every week day - but today is weekend - so not today.
      * Another note: i thought about streaming this task and that makes me hesitate even more for some reason. I would already be working on it now if i wasnt thinking about streaming it. Instead im hesitating while i think about details of streaming. BUT i know if i start the stream, then i'll instantly stop hesitating.
