  * NOTE: these can get pretty wacky. For events that are more likely to happen imo i put those here: [[Preparing - what happens when - planning - events]]
  * you are a human that has replaced greater than 95% of your original biological body with silicon/tech
  * you create a simulation and realize the agents inside have become conscious and can feel things. They begin suffering intensely. What do you do?
  * your society develops an AI that is smarter/better than any individual person at any thing, but it's not smarter/better than your society as a whole
    * things you TRY to do
      * you try to integrate with that AI
        * TODO: what does this look like?
      * you try to be competitive with AI as a collective
        * questions
          * why do you need to be competitive, why does that matter?
      * you reject AI completely
      * you reject AI partially in specific ways

    * things that happen without any human having control over it
      * ai kills everyone
      * ai tries to maximize all life in universe as best as it can (with good intentions towards ALL)
        * it tries to keep as many humans from dying as possible and starts working to make everyone immortal (all with consent - it's not forced)
