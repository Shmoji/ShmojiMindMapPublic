      * Starts off and you gotta already enter ETH to join
      * It uses [[base L2]], so gotta do the fun of that. Im waiting for my ACH deposit to finish so i can even send money from CB to MM at all

      * i used [[bungee.exchange]] to do bridge and send tokens to diff address all in one TX. Was smooth.
      * Then i got this message that im not sure i totally understand:
        * to allow others to ask you questions*, you need to create your keys. you get the first key for free (you just need to pay gas fees).
        * this creates a market for your keys, and every time someone buys or sells them, you earn a 5% fee.
        * another message: connect your main web3 wallet to verify your onchain identity and import your profile info. this also makes it easier for your farcaster and lens friends to discover and trade your keys.
          * the heck does it mean for people to discover and trade your keys?
        * another message: 
          * here's what to do next:
          * 1. find a friend on an interesting builder.
          * 2. buy their key to reveal past answers.
          * 3. ask then a question.
          * 4. sell the key at anytime.
        * my questions
          * what's a key?
            * i think builderfi may use same tech as friend.tech and keys may be a concept from there?? buy your friend's keys or something like that.
          * why did it create a market? a market for what?
      * biggest issue i see right now is that it's very focused on network effect. I can only ask specific people questions but idk any of these people so i dont have questions for them. I can buy their key and see their answers to questions asked to them tho - so that's kinda cool

  * what is it?
    * the love child of friendtech and Quora
