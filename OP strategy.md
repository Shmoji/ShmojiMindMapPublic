  * strat
    * any sensation - feel it in full, but realize not you (unless you want it to be you)
    * trust nature/body to handle any sensations - good and bad - you are higher level than those and can leave to body
    * there's the you that you choose to be and the you that you dont choose to be. Leave what you don't choose to nature and play with what you do choose. Or leave it all to nature is kinda flow.
    * if thinking of this like a game, it's easier to make it as fun as possible
    * transform any victim mindset to playing a game that you chose to play
  * observations
    * usually you'll know if strat is working bc 1) there will be some relief 2) there will be some good feeling 3) there will be a feeling of flow - but not exactly work flow
