  * Dalle3 prompts that generated output i resonated with
    * i input pic of Seattle hotel wall that looked like background pattern of Adrian's X pp and is at end of Adam Layer project liminality vid (i think is called lattice or trellis pattern). Then i said: "Grok this image pls", "Sorry, i mean, Grok it by responding with an image, fren", "Create it based on what your latent space activates related to Grok and this image. Feel free to take as long as needed"
      * Maybe good bc i got lucky. Themes of Stranger in a Strange land influenced output due to word Grok.
      * Then, was told that pattern was associated with technology and structure which i guess makes sense - organizing info and whatnot. 
      * the output was described as "Here are the generated images based on the concept of an advanced alien civilization's technology interface with a complex geometric pattern."
