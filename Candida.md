  * Facts
    * Candida species are the most common fungal pathogens to infect humans, and can cause life-threatening illnesses in individuals with compromised immune systems.
  * Brainstorming related to my issues
    * It seems this paper says that C. parapsilosis tends to cause issues with vascular stuff (varicocele, blood flow) and C. albicans is more related to inflammation.  
    * I keep seeing that Candida infection affects skin and mucosa. Maybe this explains both my mild mucosal thickening and my skin issues.
    * This paper says that statherin (naturally found in saliva) are able to decrease Candida albicans colonization and biofilm proliferation. YOOO, maybe this is why I've always produced way too much saliva, as seen during frisky times lol
    * Candida of mouth or throat can cause swollen lymph nodes
    * It's possible jaw and throat pain and lumps are due to candida settling on the salivary glands. Can read more about that here: https://www.yeastinfection.org/can-candida-overgrowth-cause-swollen-gland-and-lymph-nodes/
    * "Many people who have followed a strict candida cleanse diet found that their allergic reactions to food and environmental factors lessened, and in some cases, went away completely." - indeed is my experience
    * Sweating and detox is good for draining swollen lymph nodes: "Sweating is another helpful practice for draining lymph nodes. Detox baths are available if exercise is difficult. Jumping up and down for at least ten minutes can wake up the lymphatic system. Jump rope, jumping jacks, and trampolines are a few options. Another method is to be in a hot shower and rapidly change the water to cold. Even if candida overgrowth or another cause affects the lymph nodes, draining them will offer some relief while the underlying issue is being determined and resolved."
  * Brainstorming from Candida research
    * In response to environmental cues, C. albicans switches between ovoid yeast and elongated hyphal growth forms, and this morphological plasticity contributes to virulence. So basically, this morphological transition is essential for its survival in the host. Maybe identifying regulators involved in this process can lead to new therapies. In this study, we examined the contribution of three regulators called sirtuins (Sir2, Hst1, and Hst2) to the yeast-to-hypha transition of C. albicans . We found that loss of Sir2 but not Hst1 or Hst2 hampered hypha formation. Moreover, the defect was caused by the loss of the catalytic activity of Sir2. Our study may lay the groundwork for discovering novel targets for antifungal therapies.

  * Treating Candida
    * Drugs used to treat candida infections
      * Drug issues: Standard drug doses often become ineffective due to the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR). This leads to the use of higher drug doses for prolonged duration, resulting in severe toxicity (nephrotoxicity and liver damage) in humans. However, combination therapy using very low concentrations of two or more antifungal agents together, can lower such toxicity and limit evolution of drug resistance.
      * List of drugs: Azoles, polyenes, allylamines, and echinocandins are classes of antifungals used for treating Candida infections.
      * Echinocandins seem to be the drug that is injected only and can kill very very bad invasive Candida infection
      * Fluconazole (FLU) or Diflucan
        * is the most frequently administered antifungal drug, but its therapeutic efficacy has been limited by the emergence of drug-resistant strains.
        * Side effects

      * This paper said that FLU combined with posaconazole (POS) worked best against infection. https://www.researchhub.com/paper/1020912/antifungal-activity-of-minocycline-and-azoles-against-fluconazole-resistant-candida-species
    * Potential Drugs / alternative options against Candida
      * [[Natural antifungals against candida]]
    * Comparing treatment methods
      * More recent studies have found that oral supplementation with caprylic acid reduces the symptoms of Candida more quickly and efficiently than Diflucan.
  * Random
    * Especially when nutrients in body not doing good, H. pylori can make its way into Candida yeast cells. Then, antibiotics taken to kill H pylori don't work bc Candida protecting them. Possibly probiotics can help here
