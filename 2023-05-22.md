    * i noticed at end of work day, im basically in derp mode and cant function socially. Was just talking with new person and my socializing function just didn't work lol. I think it's because ive been thinking on long time scales all day and then when my mind switches to short time scales, it's using intuition, but for some reason this leaves me at a blank. it's like i cant process info at those short timescales. Seems it's mainly my ability to output high info ideas at short time scales that is blocked. I think ability to intake high info at short time scales is also hindered. Maybe because my self is clinging to too much info from all the thinking done during work day? To other people I just seem like i never know how to respond or awk lol
