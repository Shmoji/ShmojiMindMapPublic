    * Is getting good vocals in a song all about getting really good at exuding something that surprises your mind?
    * What if my thing becomes the guy that talks about deep stuff with sad music in background with videos of my life in visual background. I mean i already just make vids talking with just my face. Can maybe even blend life videos with me talking video lol.

    * Took Claritin today at noon. It did not help with skin burning or sinuses. It helped a lil with jaw pain maybe, but jaw still hurtin like 4/10
    * Was like 9/10 most this afternoon. Really bad in last hour. It was spent in desk chair playing games. Then, i brushed my teeth and laid down. A little boogie felt out while brushing. Slightly less pressure now in bed. Either because boogie leaving or because not in sitting posture anymore - my guess
