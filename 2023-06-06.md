  * [[Log of health notes]]
    * ate cod liver and 1 hour later i have this endless mental energy and im coming up with ideas instantly and in flow state. Maybe that means one of the vitamins/etc it gives is something im deficient in. Vitamins cod liver has: Vitamin A, Vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Vitamin E, Vitamin K - i will track how long this energy lasts. EDIT: it lasted into afternoon
