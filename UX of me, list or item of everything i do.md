  * what is this?
    * i'll attach this to items that represent a THING i do. Ex: watching anime
  * keypoints
    * thought behind this is that i could literally create a list of all ACTIONS i do. Could be super useful for goal-grounded actions with tough blockers. Could even create a format with variables to properly explain my UX to LLMs and get better responses
    * seems these are most useful for me to find the actions that i spend most of time doing in specific detail
  * questions
    * how do these breakdown?
      * i think they start at max abstraction. Then, they break down to smaller categories. Then, you reach different types of ACTIONS:
        * 1) CONTINUOUS: not grounded in end-goal. I guess mainly for fun. For ex: watching ALTTP speedruns
        * 2) GOAL-GROUNDED: actions are executed in order to accomplish end goal. Main focus is on blockers and overcoming them
        * 3) CATEGORIES: many times you wont know you're stuck on a category and need to either break down to more tangible action or choose between 1 and 2
