  * structure
    * electrical circuits
      * ex of simple circuit: batter with plus and minus, wire from plus goes to a switch that can be turned on and off, which then has wire to lightbulb, which then has wire back to minus of battery
      * modern computer components (like what?) typically supply a voltage of 3.3 or 5 volts between positive terminal and negative terminal (the ground). Computers treat things as binary (on or off) based on whether voltage is high or low
    * [[transistor]]
    * silicon
      * a semiconductor with 4 valence electrons - but it is doped/mixed with other elements
