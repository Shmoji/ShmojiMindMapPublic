  * effects on health issues
    * jaw pain

        * Pain was around 6-7/10, after a few tokes, at about 3-4/10
    * sinus pain

      * Tried the 50:50 ratio with little less than 50% of dropper - honestly barely felt anything. Can safely do 1/2 or lil more next time. Having high pain day and pain did get slightly better 
    * [[2023-07-16]]
      * tried 50:50 ratio and 1st hour was quite chill despite slight changes in experience. Things felt slightly more authentic in terms of connection between me and that experience. Barely felt much tho
      * At about 1 hour after taking, i got hit out of nowhere and was like 5.5/10 ðŸª¨ ed. It almost felt like it was triggered by something I was doing and maybe wouldn't have gotten more intense otherwise, but idk
      * Harder to access the long-form thinking self in an outer visual way during this
      * it's all mental content ðŸ˜† think im talking about all qualia. For a sec, i got some infinite loop mental/visual thing and then realized even that was mental content and then could easily context switch after that
      * Something about the mind is capped. In relation to how you can Virtual Machine your mind infinitely up. But eventually you find some end point when you go towards low level sensations - like a cap or limit or origin or something. But the other direction can always continue going. Building more layers of VMs in VMs.
      * Sometimes going high up in the list (higher dimension) can become scary or intense. But you can always focus on real self that is formless and then the tower of VMs starts back at 0 or 1
      * what if nature grows perfectly with the abstract
      * feel like i truly understand, feel, and experience mother nature right now. Not in fauna type way - but in more authentic way i suppose
      * could imagine a trigger for humans to find that will signal advanced people to detect us as advanced civilization. Trigger could be all humans to enter 1 mental state that is same. So makes Earth a 0 or 1 if entire society can flip value.
      * so i did slightly more than half a dropper - and now i know - cannot do stuff after this amount. I could if i really forced myself, but will be super focused and will be so hard to contain that focus.  
      * your body and all material is nature. technology is nature. i bet there will be entire wars over nature vs the abstract (part of me wants to say the unreal, but doesn't completely feel right). When really you need to see that both are in a beautiful dance and you can be with both without conflict. 
      * this has been quite the intense event 
      * i feel non duel philosophy is ideal for keeping your focus on embodiment no matter how many dimensions up you go
      * For the last half of the time - pains were pretty intense - so seems if you go overboard, it does the opposite of help with the chronic pain
