                * GPT4
                  * Function: Candibactin-AR is an herbal supplement commonly used to manage Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO). It contains a blend of oils and extracts that possess anti-microbial properties.
                  * Target: It aims to REDUCE the overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, which is the primary issue in SIBO.
                  * Ingredients: Contains oils like thyme and oregano that have been shown to possess anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties.
                  * Mechanism: Helps in killing or inhibiting the growth of excess bacteria in the small intestine, which can alleviate symptoms like bloating, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
                  * Alternative: It's considered a more natural alternative to antibiotics like Rifaximin, which are also used for SIBO treatment.
            * my journal while researching on this
              * most redditors seem to say it helped with sibo from this first session of my research

            * why take?
              * GPT4
                * Target Biofilms: SIBO often involves bacterial communities that form biofilms, making them resistant to antibiotics and other treatments.
                * Enhance Treatment Efficacy: Disrupting biofilms may increase the effectiveness of antibiotics or herbal antimicrobials used for treating SIBO.
            * my journal while researching on this
              * redditors seem to be mixed on its usefulness.
              * research looks potentially good but idk
          * 6) MORNING TEA and B4 DINNER: a #prokinetic - idk what yet - i prefer something natural

          * 2) start Colostrum to help heal gut
  * signals that i do have sibo
    * my test for SIBO is positive for hydrogen producing bacteria
  * signals that i dont have sibo
    * apparently sibo patients dont get stomach growling and rarely feel hungry - i feel hungry all the time and get stomach growling...i think
  * [[tracking breath tests, triosmart, sibo]]
