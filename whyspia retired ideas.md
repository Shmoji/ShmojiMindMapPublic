  * precise tasks
    * maybe add "how" or "why" buttons on each mission point. Maybe even make so popup/new-content is simple and right there on same page without needing to travel to new page. maybe ill have way to insert subjective user desires here instead of one objective statement for whys and hows
      * maybe i can put journal pages for each on github, which then links to everyone's personal journal. and then i can just write out journal entries for each point here in shmoji language instead of trying to be concise/professional
    * [ ] create whyspia places place/map (i really like gathertown spaces lobby as example). Make so people can create a place in DB, which then prompts them with some UX to create nested structure that leads to URLs they enter (map). Maybe has 1) quick links folder to just get to content asap. Maybe iz just like PKM page, they can create whatevs they want. There is certain organization id personally like tho: 1) quick links 2) click here to VISIT 3) map for world (if spawning in diff locations possible...maybe coordinates eventually?). I imagine map is just like quick links except with optional image too. Would love some tagging method to make it obv if something is a world (2d or 3d) vs an app like facebook or just static site
      * so it seems i basically wanna somewhat recreate how my site is like an index except for any user (and more in PKM style)
