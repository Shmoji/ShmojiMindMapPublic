    * The other day the only unusual thing i did was drink cup of milk in afternoon and then that night, felt like stone moved a lil
    * Also, one day my kidneys randomly hurt a lot less than most other days. Only thing different there was that i ate only one meal. Another dif is that i went over 24H without banana.
    * Cancelled appointment with Dr Brandon Rubens bc fucc that guy
    * Had first round of acupuncture for kidney stone. During acupuncture i could feel location of stone spasming, so obv he triggered something related to the stone somehow.
