  * what is it
    * list of metaverses. only from their platform right now. in terms of what they display. But since worlds are NFTs, any URL can show these metaverses i think
    * tech to build metaverses on that is integrated with web3
    * each metaverse is a NFT itself i think (that's what mint button is on their home page)
  * other cool things
    * you can edit your metaverse in the web in realtime
    * you can invite people to build your world with you collaboratively
    * Add metaverse-ready NFTs from your wallet in one-click
  * issues
    * when i tried it out, many of the worlds would bug out before loading or they would be too buggy after finished loading. Not sure where that issue lies. Maybe in my quest 2
  * current state
    * seems not many people use it, but lots of potential
  * things that are maybe bullish
    * fact that this tech allows anyone to build metaverse that are directly integrated with web3
    * being able to edit metaverse in the web
  * questions
    * since the metaverses are NFTs, does that mean eventually these metaverses could be hosted all around the web - or is there some centralized Hyperfy engine required to make these NFT world viewable?
