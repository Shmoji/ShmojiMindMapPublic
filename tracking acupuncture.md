      * 1st session
        * when putting needles in and before
          * he pressed on lower stomach in certain ways and it caused gurgles
          * after needles in face, my eyes spasmed for a while
        * while laying there
          * felt bit of pain in right heel
          * stomach gurgled like crazy
          * had few near kidney area spasms I assume from gut
          * felt pressure under eyes, but just about same as usual
          * felt dizzy for a sec when he asked foods that worsen bloating and i was struggling to remember
          * said i may feel tears and as he said it i felt like one for a sec, then instantly calm. Unsure if accidentally suppressed or what
        * after session
          * bro loudly cracked my wrists. You would've thought he snapped them lol
          * felt some tension in kidney areas throughout day that eventually went away
    * [[2024-04-02]]
      * while laying there
        * felt cold wet sensation on left eyebrow near nose for about 1-2 minutes. It was quite alarming and worried me about my left eye
        * felt my body just tensed up in throat/jaw area and legs/butt-bone area - then i could release it. By default it would sometimes come back
        * at very beginning had good bit of pain in left leg so he had to remove that needle
        * only thing that brought tears:
          * thinking about all pain mom has went though and wanting to help. Also wondering if i actually physically process some of that for her
      * after session
        * felt so insanely calm as i walked out
        * noticed left eye eye floater a few times
        * felt some tension in kidney areas throughout day that eventually went away
    * [[2024-04-19]]
      * when putting needles in and before
        * needle in right hand pinched for a minute or so but not too bad
        * think he put needle near mid chest but didn't feel it. Then he put one in left ear (which i didnt feel) but right when he did i got pain in mid chest that made me grunt loudly lol but then was good
        * he said focused on fear of unknown and stress this time
      * after session
        * felt left kidney area short pains and stomach gurgles at same time - only few times
        * gave new supplement for stress and digestion called Xiao Yao San
