  * what are they?
    * These are spiral galaxies with extremely radio and x-ray bright nuclei. They constitute about 2% of spiral galaxies and their nucleus energy emission is about 100 times that of the Milky Way. The nucleus size is about 1 AU which is the distance between the Earth and the Sun.
    * A Seyfert galaxy spectrum has very strong, broad emission lines. These lines suggest the gas in the nucleus is very hot — about 100 million kelvin. The broad lines suggest the gas is rotating rapidly (10,000 km/s) around a massive object in the core of the galaxy…sounds like a black hole.
