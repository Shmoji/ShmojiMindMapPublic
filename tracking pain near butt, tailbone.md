      * for first time in while, i decided to resist both lust and overeating
      * been resisting lust for a while with strong energy needed to get over horni wave 2 days ago. once past that wave it became easy
      * just started resisting overeating. last night i didnt snack on anything else after main dinner
      * i note these bc those were only differences in my life that stood out
      * as falling asleep last night i got a few literal ZAPS on my tailbone/butthole area lmao. like 5-7/10 pain that was quick
      * then, i had crazy dream surfacing something from my subconscious that had never been observed before in detail. it was a nice dream actually
