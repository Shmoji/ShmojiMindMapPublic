        * i intensely focus on myself. i focus on what i should say and try to make sure it is extremely correct.

      * possible solutions
        * allow myself to be stupid. allow myself to fail. and try to do that early. try to ask for help from adversarial person.
    * How to not take the above question's fear with me into all social interactions?
  * Deep questions [[questions about control]]
    * Every action in your day is because you want something. Does desire always mean you want control over something (internal or external) by using change? Is the action to understand always an action to control? #[[control, self control]] #Desires
      * I'd say yes. If you want to go from state A to state B, then that means you want change. You want control over something, maybe internal or external. Maybe you'd just subtly feel better internally if some thing changed.
        * BUT it's probably best to keep your desires, but not be affected internally by if the outcome you want comes or not. But also dont be affected by being affected lol. Basically, dont rely on your self for the outcome, rely on God. But dont use that as excuse to do nothing. You can work towards outcomes, but dont rely on yourself internally for them. 
        * Is the main issue of control that as you focus on relying on self more, your focus is on a predicted outcome and NOT reality and not the moment?
    * What is the purpose of reasoning / thinking?
      * The purpose of reasoning is to fix your intuitions. Think of intuitions as a black box neural network interfacing with reality in more ways than you understand, reasoning as a prover that can test and correct the output and reverse engineer, debug and train the network
      * related questions
        * is the purpose of reasoning / thinking to plan for future events and predict outcomes so that your in-the-moment actions are better?

  * questions on my mind's relationship with various things
    * what is my relationship with "master and slave"?
  * [[questions about simulations]]
