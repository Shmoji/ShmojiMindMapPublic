  * what is it?
    * Diamine oxidase (DAO) is an enzyme that your body makes to break down histamine from foods. If your body doesn't produce enough DAO, you may have diamine oxidase deficiency. â€ŒWithout enough of this enzyme, you can experience histamine intolerance, also called food histaminosis or enteral histaminosis. This can make you sick when you eat foods that contain histamine.
  * what it do?
    * some people have histamine intolerance. DAO enzyme supplements can help because it's an enzyme that "eats" histamine in the gut
